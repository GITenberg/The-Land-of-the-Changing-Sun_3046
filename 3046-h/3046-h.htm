    <h2>
      Chapter I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The balloon seemed scarcely to move, though it was slowly sinking toward
      the ocean of white clouds which hung between it and the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two inmates of the car were insensible; their faces were bloodless,
      their cheeks sunken. They were both young and handsome. Harry Johnston, an
      American, was as dark and sallow as a Spaniard. Charles Thorndyke, an
      English gentleman, had yellow hair and mustache, blue eyes and a fine
      intellectual face. Both were tall, athletic in build and
      well-proportioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was the first to come to consciousness as the balloon sank into
      less rarefied atmosphere. He opened his eyes dreamily and looked curiously
      at the white face of his friend in his lap. Then he shook him and tried to
      call his name, but his lips made no sound. Drawing himself up a little
      with a hand on the edge of the basket, he reached for a water-jug and
      sprinkled Thorndyke's face. In a moment he was rewarded by seeing the eyes
      of the latter slowly open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know;&rdquo; Johnston answered, &ldquo;getting nearer to the earth, for we
      can breathe more easily. I can't remember much after the professor fell
      from the car. My God, old man! I shall never forget the horror in the poor
      fellow's eyes as he clung to the rope down there and begged us to save
      him. I tried to get you to look, but you were dozing off. I attempted to
      draw him up, but the rope on the edge of the basket was tipping it, and
      both you and I came near following him. I tried to keep from seeing his
      horrible face as the rope began to slip through his fingers. I knew the
      instant he let go by our shooting upward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to myself and looked over when the basket tipped,&rdquo; replied the
      Englishman, &ldquo;I thought I was going too, but I could not stir a muscle to
      prevent it. He said something desperately, but the wind blew it away and
      covered his face with his beard, so that I could not see the movement of
      his lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been some instructions to us about the management of the
      balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not&mdash;perhaps a good-bye, or a message to his wife and child.
      Poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have we been out of our heads?&rdquo; and Johnston looked over the
      side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the slightest idea. Days and nights may have passed since he
      fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. I remember coming to myself for an instant, and it seemed
      that we were being jerked along at the rate of a gunshot. My God, it was
      awful! It was as black as condensed midnight. I felt your warm body
      against me and was glad I was not alone. Then I went off again, but into a
      sort of nightmare. I thought I was in Hell, and that you were with me, and
      that Professor Helmholtz was Satan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we be?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I can't tell what is beneath those clouds. It may be earth,
      sea or ocean; we were evidently whisked along in a storm while we were out
      of our heads. If we are above the ocean we are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke looked over the edge of the car long and attentively, then he
      exclaimed suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is the ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It reflects the sunlight. It is too bright for land. When we got above
      the clouds at the start it looked darker below than it does now; we may be
      over the middle of the Atlantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going down,&rdquo; said Johnston gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we are, and it means something serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston made no answer. Half-an-hour went by. Thorndyke looked at the
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the professor had not dropped the compass, we could find our
      bearings,&rdquo; he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston pointed upward. Thin clouds were floating above them. &ldquo;We are
      almost down,&rdquo; he said, and as they looked over the sides of the car they
      saw the reflection of the sun on the bosom of the ocean, and, a moment
      later, they caught sight of the blue billows rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see something that looks like an island,&rdquo; observed Thorndyke, looking
      in the direction toward which the balloon seemed to be drifting. &ldquo;It is
      dark and is surrounded by light. It is far away, but we may reach it if we
      do not descend too rapidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw out the last bag of sand,&rdquo; suggested the American, &ldquo;we need it as
      little now as we ever shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke cut the bag with his knife and watched the sand filter through
      the bottom of the basket and trail along in a graceful stream behind the
      balloon. The great flabby bag overhead steadied itself, rose slightly and
      drifted on toward the dark spot on the vast expanse of sunlit water. They
      could now clearly see that it was a small island, not more than a mile in
      circumference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two miles,&rdquo; answered the American laconically, &ldquo;it is a chance for
      us, but a slim one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The balloon gradually sank. For twenty minutes the car glided along not
      more than two hundred feet above the waves. The island was now quite near.
      It was a barren mound of stone, worn into gullies and sharp precipices by
      the action of the waves and rain. Hardly a tree or a shrub was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like the rocky crown of a great stone mountain hidden in the
      ocean,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;half a mile to the shore, a hundred feet to
      the water; at this rate of speed the wind would smash us against those
      rocks like a couple of bird's eggs dropped from the clouds. We must fall
      into the water and swim ashore. There is no use trying to save the
      balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better be about it, then,&rdquo; said Johnston, rising stiffly and
      holding to the ropes. &ldquo;If we should go down in the water with the balloon
      we would get tangled in the ropes and get asphyxiated with the gas. We had
      better hang down under the basket and let go at exactly the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water was not more than forty feet beneath, and the island was getting
      nearer every instant. The two aeronauts swung over on opposite sides of
      the car and, face to face, hung by their hands beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dread the plunge,&rdquo; muttered Thorndyke; &ldquo;I feel as weak as a sick
      kitten; I am not sure that I can swim that distance, but the water looks
      still enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am played out too,&rdquo; grunted the American, red in the face; &ldquo;but it
      looks like our only chance. Ugh! she made a big dip then. We'd better let
      go. I'll count three, and three is the signal. Now ready. One, two,
      three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down shot the balloonists and up bounded the great liberated bag of gas;
      the basket and dangling ropes swung wildly from side to side. The
      aeronauts touched the water feet foremost at the same instant, and in half
      a minute they rose, not ten feet apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; sputtered Johnston, shaking his bushy head like a swimming
      dog. &ldquo;Look, the shore is not very far.&rdquo; Thorndyke was saving his wind, and
      said nothing, but accommodated his stroke to that of his companion, and
      thus they breasted the gently-rolling billows until finally, completely
      exhausted, they climbed up the shelving rocks and lay down in the warm
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a very encouraging outlook,&rdquo; said Johnston, rising when his clothing
      was dry and climbing a slight elevation. &ldquo;There is nothing in sight except
      a waste of stone. Let's go up to that point and look around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ascent was exceedingly trying, for the incline was steep and it was at
      times difficult to get a firm footing. But they were repaid for the
      exertion, for they had reached the highest point of the island and could
      see all over it. As far as their vision reached there was nothing beyond
      the little island except the glistening waves that reached out till they
      met the sky in all directions. High up in the clouds they saw the balloon,
      now steadily drifting with the wind toward the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well be dead and done with it,&rdquo; grumbled Thorndyke. &ldquo;Ships
      are not apt to approach this isolated spot, and even if they did, how
      could we give a signal of distress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston stroked his dark beard thoughtfully, then he pointed toward the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some driftwood and seaweed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;with my sun-glass I can
      soon have a bonfire.&rdquo; He took a piece of punk from a waterproof box that
      he carried in his pocket and focussed the sun's rays on it. &ldquo;Run down and
      bring me an armful of dry seaweed and wood,&rdquo; he added, intent on his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke clambered down to the shore, and in a few minutes returned with
      an armful of fuel. Johnston was blowing his punk into a flame, and in a
      moment had a blazing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; approved the Englishman, rubbing his hands together over the
      flames. &ldquo;We'll keep it burning and it may do some good.&rdquo; Then a smile of
      satisfaction came over his face as he began to take some clams from his
      pockets. &ldquo;Plenty of these fellows down there, and they are as fat and
      juicy as can be. Hurry up and let's bake them. I'm as hungry as a bear.
      There is a fine spring of fresh water below, too, so we won't die of
      thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They baked the clams and ate them heartily, and then went down to the
      spring near the shore. The water was deliciously cool and invigorating.
      The sun sank into the quiet ocean and night crept on. The stars came out
      slowly, and the moon rose full and red from the waves, adding its beams to
      the flickering light of the fire on the hill-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we take a walk all round on the beach,&rdquo; proposed the Englishman;
      &ldquo;there is no telling what we may find; we may run on something that has
      drifted ashore from some wrecked ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston consented. They had encompassed the entire island, which was oval
      in shape, and were about to ascend to the rock to put fresh fuel on the
      fire before lying down to sleep for the night, when Thorndyke noticed a
      road that had evidently been worn in the rock by human footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made by feet,&rdquo; he said, bending down and looking closely at the rock and
      raking up a handful of white sand, &ldquo;but whether the feet of savage or
      civilized mortal I can't make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was a few yards ahead of him and stooped to pick up something
      glittering in the moonlight. It was a tap from the heel of a shoe and was
      of solid silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Civilized,&rdquo; he said, holding it out to his companion; &ldquo;and of the very
      highest order of civilization. Whoever heard of people rich enough to wear
      silver heel-taps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it is silver?&rdquo; asked the Englishman, examining it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pure and unalloyed; see how the stone has cut into it, and feel its
      weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I believe,&rdquo; returned Thorndyke, as Johnston put the
      strange trophy into his pocket-book, and the two adventurers paused a
      moment and looked mutely into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't the faintest idea of where we are,&rdquo; said Johnston, his tone
      showing that he was becoming more despondent. &ldquo;We don't know how long we
      were unconscious in the balloon, nor where we were taken in the storm. We
      may now be in the very centre of the North Polar sea&mdash;this knob may
      be the very pivot on which this end of the earth revolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman laughed. &ldquo;No danger; the sun is too natural. From the poles
      it would look different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean the old sun that you read so much about, and that they make
      so much racket over at home, but another of which we are the original
      discoverer&mdash;a sun that isn't in old Sol's beat at all, but one that
      revolves round the earth from north to south and dips in once a day at the
      north and the south poles. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman laughed heartily and slapped his friend on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are somewhere in the Atlantic; but your finding that heel-tap
      does puzzle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to have an adventure, beside which all others of our lives
      will pale into insignificance. I feel it in my bones. See how evenly this
      road has been worn and it is leading toward the centre of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the two adventurers came to a point in the road where
      tall cliffs on either side stood up perpendicularly. It was dark and cold,
      and but a faint light from the moon shone down to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like this,&rdquo; said Johnston, who was behind the Englishman; &ldquo;we may
      be walking into the ambush of an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and Thorndyke plunged on into the gloomy passage. Presently the
      walls began to widen like a letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and in a great open space they saw
      a placid lake on the bosom of which the moon was shining. On all sides the
      towering walls rose for hundreds of feet. Speechless with wonder and with
      quickly-beating hearts they stumbled forward over the uneven road till
      they reached the shore of the lake. The water was so clear and still that
      the moon and stars were reflected in it as if in a great mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; exclaimed Thorndyke, pointing down into the depths, &ldquo;what
      can that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston followed Thorndyke's finger with his eyes. At first he thought
      that it was a comet moving across the sky and reflected in the water; but,
      on glancing above, he saw his mistake. It looked, at first, like a great
      ball of fire rolling along the bottom of the lake with a stream of flame
      in its wake.

    <h2>
      Chapter II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two men watched it for several minutes; all the time it seemed to be
      growing larger and brighter till, after a while, they saw that the light
      came from something shaped like a ship, sharp at both ends, and covered
      with oval glass. As it slowly rose to the surface they saw that it
      contained five or six men, sitting in easy chairs and reclining on
      luxurious divans. One of them sat at a sort of pilot-wheel and was
      directing the course of the strange craft, which was moving as gracefully
      as a great fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young men saw the man at the pilot-wheel raise his hand, and from
      the water came the musical notes of a great bell. The vessel stopped, and
      one of the men sprang up and raised an instrument that looked like a
      telescope to his eyes. With this he seemed to be closely searching the
      lake shores, for he did not move for several minutes. Then he lowered the
      instrument, and when the bell had rung again, the vessel rose slowly and
      perpendicularly to the surface and glided to the shore within twenty yards
      of where the adventurers stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could they have seen us?&rdquo; whispered Thorndyke, drawing Johnston nearer
      the side of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so; at all events, they are between us and the outlet; we may as
      well make the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men, all except the pilot, landed, and a dazzling electric
      search-light was turned on the spot where Thorndyke and Johnston stood.
      For a moment they were so blinded that they could not see, and then they
      heard footsteps, and, their eyes becoming accustomed to the light, they
      found themselves surrounded by several men, very strangely clad. They all
      wore long cloaks that covered them from head to foot and every man was
      more than six feet in height and finely proportioned. One of them, who
      seemed to be an officer in command, bowed politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Captain Tradmos, gentlemen, in the king's service. It is my duty to
      make you my prisoners. I must escort you to the palace of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's cool,&rdquo; said Johnston, to conceal the discomfiture that he felt,
      &ldquo;we had no idea that you had a kingdom. We have tramped all over this
      island, and you are the first signs of humanity we have met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have recalled his words before he had finished speaking, if he
      could have done so, for he saw by the manner of the captain that he had
      been over bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; answered the officer curtly, and with a motion of his hand to
      his men he turned toward the odd-looking vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two adventurers obeyed, and the cloaked men fell in behind them.
      Neither Johnston nor Thorndyke had ever seen anything like the peculiar
      boat that was moored to the rocky shore. It was about forty feet in
      length, had a hull shaped like a racing yacht, but which was made of black
      rubber inflated with air. It was covered with glass, save for a doorway
      about six feet high and three feet wide in the side, and looked like a
      great oblong bubble floating on the still dark water. As they approached
      the searchlight was extinguished, and they were enabled to see the boat to
      a better advantage by the aid of the electric lights that illuminated the
      interior. It was with feelings of awe that the two adventurers followed
      the captain across the gang-plank into the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electric light was brilliantly white, and in various places pink, red
      and light-blue screens mellowed it into an artistic effect that was very
      soothing to the eye. The ceiling was hung with festoons of prisms as
      brilliant as the purest diamonds, and in them, owing to the gently
      undulatory movement of the vessel, colors more beautiful than those of a
      rainbow played entrancingly. Rare pictures in frames of delicate gold were
      interspersed among the clusters of prisms, and the floor was covered with
      carpets that felt as soft beneath the foot as pillows of eider-down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the door the officer threw off his gray cloak, and his men
      did likewise, disclosing to view the finest uniforms the prisoners had
      ever seen. Captain Tradmos's legs were clothed in tights of light-blue
      silk, and he wore a blue sack-coat of silk plush and a belt of pliant
      gold, the buckles of which were ornamented with brilliant gems. His eyes
      were dark and penetrating, and his black hair lay in glossy masses on his
      shoulders. He had the head of an Apollo and a brow indicative of the
      highest intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his men in the first room that they entered, he gracefully
      conducted his prisoners through another room to a small cabin in the stern
      of the boat, and told them to make themselves comfortable on the luxurious
      couches that lined the circular glass walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our journey will be of considerable length,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as you are no
      doubt fatigued, you had better take all the rest you can get. I see that
      you need food and have ordered a repast which will refresh you.&rdquo; As he
      concluded he touched a button in the wall and instantly a table, laden
      with substantial food, rare delicacies and wines, rose through a trap-door
      in the floor. He smiled at the expressions of surprise on their faces and
      touched a green bottle of wine with his white tapering hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater part of our journey will be under water, and our wines are
      specially prepared to render us capable of subsisting on a rather limited
      quantity of air during the voyage, so I advise you to partake of them
      freely; you will find them very agreeable to the taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very grateful,&rdquo; bowed Thorndyke, from his seat on a couch. &ldquo;I am
      sure no prisoners were ever more graciously or royally entertained. To be
      your prisoner is a pleasure to be remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till our heads are cut off, anyway,&rdquo; put in the irrepressible American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos smiled good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you now,&rdquo; he said, and with a bow he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an adventure in earnest,&rdquo; whispered Johnston; &ldquo;my stars! what can
      they intend to do with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the first things will be to take us down to the bottom of this
      lake where we saw them awhile ago, and I don't fancy it at all; what if
      this blasted glass-case should burst? We may have dropped into a den of
      outlaws on a gigantic scale, and it may be necessary to put us out of the
      way to keep our mouths closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hungry, and am going to eat,&rdquo; said the American, drawing a cushioned
      stool up to the table. &ldquo;Here goes for some of the wine; remember, it is a
      sort of breath-restorer. I am curious enough not to want to collapse till
      I have seen this thing through. He said something about a palace and a
      king. Where can we be going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down into the centre of the earth, possibly,&rdquo; and the handsome Englishman
      moved a stool to the table and took the glass of green-colored wine that
      Johnston pushed toward him. &ldquo;Some scientists hold that the earth is filled
      with water instead of fire. Who knows where this blamed thing may not take
      us? Here is to a safe return from the amphibious land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both drank their wine simultaneously, lowered their glasses at the same
      instant, and gazed into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever taste such liquor?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke, &ldquo;it seems to run like
      streams of fire through every vein I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shook his head mutely, and held the sparkling effervescing fluid
      between him and the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! take it down,&rdquo; cried the Englishman, &ldquo;it throws a green color on
      your face that makes you look like a corpse.&rdquo; Johnston clinked the glass
      against that of his companion and they drained the glasses. &ldquo;Hush, what
      was that?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound like boiling water outside and as if air were being
      pumped out of some receptacle, and the vessel began to move up and down in
      a lithe sort of fashion and to bend tortuously from side to side like a
      great sluggish fish. Through the partitions of glass they saw one of the
      men closing the door, and in a moment the vessel glided away from the
      shore. The men all sank into easy positions on the couches, and delightful
      music as soft as an Aeolian lyre seemed to be breathed from the walls and
      floor. Then the music seemed to die away and a bell down in the vessel's
      hull rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in the middle of the lake,&rdquo; said Thorndyke, looking through the
      glass toward the black cliffy shore; &ldquo;the next thing will be our descent.
      I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was unable to proceed, and Johnston noticed in alarm that his eyes
      were slightly protruding from their sockets. The air seemed suddenly to
      become more compact as if compressed, and the water was set into such
      violent commotion that it was dashed against the glass sides in billows as
      white as snow. Then Johnston found that he could not breathe freely, and
      he understood the trouble of the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Tradmos came suddenly to the door. He was smiling as he motioned
      toward the wines on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better drink more of the wine,&rdquo; he advised sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of the captives rushed to the table. The instant they had swallowed
      the wine they felt relieved, but were still weak. The captain bowed and
      went away. Thorndyke's hand trembled as he refilled his friend's glass. &ldquo;I
      thought I was gone up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never had such a choky sensation in my
      life; you are still purple in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat of what is before you,&rdquo; said the captain, looking in at the door;
      &ldquo;you cannot stand the increasing pressure unless you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They needed no second invitation, for they were half-famished. The fish
      and meat were delicious, and the bread was delightfully sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look outside!&rdquo; cried Johnston. The water was now still, but it was
      gradually rising up the sides of the boat, and in a moment it had closed
      over the crystal roof. Both of the captives were conscious of a heavy
      sensation in the head and a dull roaring in the ears. Down they went, at
      first slowly and then more rapidly, till it seemed to them that they had
      descended over a thousand feet. Great monsters like whales swam to the
      vessel, as if attracted by the lights, and their massive bodies jarred
      against the glass walls as they turned to swim away. They sank about five
      hundred feet lower; and all at once the lights went out, and the boat
      gradually stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at once so dark that the two captives could not see each other,
      though only the width of the table separated them. Everything was
      profoundly still; not a sound came from the men in the other rooms.
      Presently Thorndyke whispered, &ldquo;Look, do you see that red light overhead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnston, &ldquo;it looks like a star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our bonfire,&rdquo; said Thorndyke, &ldquo;that's what betrayed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the vessel began to sink, and more rapidly than ever; indeed, as
      Thorndyke expressed it, he had the cool feeling that nervous people
      experience in going down quickly in an elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we go any lower,&rdquo; he added, as the great rubber hull seemed to
      struggle like some living monster, &ldquo;the sides of this thing will collapse
      like an egg-shell and we will be as flat as pancakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear, we have much lower to go!&rdquo; It was the captain's voice,
      but they could not tell from whence it came. Then they heard again the
      seductive music, and it was so soothing that they soon fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no idea how long they had slept, but they were awakened by the
      ringing of a bell and felt the vessel was coming to a stop. They were
      still far beneath the surface; indeed, the boat was resting on the bottom,
      for in the light of two or three powerful search-lights they saw a wide
      succession of submerged hills, vales, and rugged cliffs. Before them was a
      great mountain-side and in it they saw the mouth of a dark tunnel. They
      had scarcely noticed it before the vessel rose a little and glided toward
      the tunnel and entered it. Through the glass walls they could see that it
      was narrow, and that the ragged sides and roof were barely far enough
      apart to admit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly one of the men came in and drew a curtain down behind them, and,
      with a vexed look on his face retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone Johnston put his lips close to Thorndyke's ear and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as he drew the curtain down I saw what looked to me like a cliff of
      solid gold. It had been dug out into a cavern in which I saw a vessel like
      this, and men in diving suits digging and loading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This took the Englishman's breath away for a moment, then he remarked:
      &ldquo;That accounts for the heel-tap we found; who knows, these people may be
      possessors of the richest gold and silver mines on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang again. &ldquo;We are rising,&rdquo; said Johnston. &ldquo;If this is the only
      way of reaching the king's domain, we could never get back to civilization
      unless they release us of their own accord, that's certain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, isn't it still!&rdquo; exclaimed the Englishman. &ldquo;The machinery of
      this thing moves as noiselessly as the backbone of an eel. I wish I could
      understand its works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more concerned about where we are going. I tell you we are being
      taken to some wonderful place. People who can construct such marvels of
      mechanical skill as this boat will not be behind in other things; then
      look at the physiques of those giants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the man who had drawn down the shade came in and raised it. Both
      the captives pretended to be uninterested in his movements, but when he
      had withdrawn they looked through the glass eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; whispered Thorndyke, in the ear of his companion, &ldquo;the walls are
      close to us, and are as perpendicular as those of the lake in which they
      found us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston said nothing. His attention was riveted to the walls of rock; the
      vessel was rising rapidly. An hour passed. The soft music had ceased, and
      the air seemed less dense and fresher. Then the waters suddenly parted
      over the roof and ran in crystal streams down the oval glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the surface, and the vessel was slowly gliding toward the
      shore which could not be seen owing to there now being no light except
      that inside the boat. Captain Tradmos entered, followed by two of his men
      holding black silken bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must blindfold you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;captives are not allowed to see the
      entrance to our kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word they submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the captain kindly, and, holding to an arm of each, he
      piloted them out of the vessel to the shore. Then he led them through what
      they imagined to be a long stone corridor or arcade from the ringing
      echoes of their feet on the stone pavement. Presently they came to what
      seemed to be an elevator, for when they had entered it and sat down, they
      heard a metallic door slide back into its place, and they descended
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could form no idea as to the distance they went down; but Thorndyke
      declared afterward that it was over ten thousand feet. When the elevator
      stopped Captain Tradmos led them out, and both of the captives were
      conscious of breathing the purest, most invigorating air they had ever
      inhaled. Instantly their strength returned, and they felt remarkably
      buoyant as they were led along over another pavement of polished stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos laughed. &ldquo;You like the atmosphere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of anything like it,&rdquo; said Thorndyke. &ldquo;It is so delightful
      I can almost taste it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that which made Alpha what it is&mdash;the most wonderful country
      in the universe,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;There is much in store for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ears of the two captives were greeted by a vague, indefinable hum,
      like and yet unlike that of a busy city. It was like many far-off sounds
      carefully muffled. Now and then they heard human voices, laughter, and
      singing in the distance, and the twanging of musical instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they knew that they were entering a building of some sort, for they
      heard a key turn in a lock and the humming sound in the distance was cut
      off. They felt a soft carpet under their feet, and the feet of their
      guards no longer clinked on the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bandages were removed they found themselves in a sumptuous
      chamber, alone with the captain. The brilliant light from a
      quaintly-shaped candelabrum, in the centre of the chamber, dazzled them,
      but in a few minutes their eyes had become accustomed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos seemed to be enjoying the looks of astonishment on their faces as
      they glanced at the different objects in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is night,&rdquo; he said smilingly. &ldquo;You need rest after your voyage. Lie
      down on the beds and sleep. To-morrow you will be conducted to the palace
      of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a bow he withdrew, and they heard a massive bolt slide into the
      socket of a door hidden behind a curtain. The two men gazed at each other
      without speaking, for a moment, and then they began to inspect the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In alcoves half-veiled with silken curtains stood statues in gold and
      bronze. The walls and ceilings were decorated with pictures unlike any
      they had ever seen. Before one, the picture of an angel flying through a
      dark, star-filled sky, they both stood enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke, finding voice finally. &ldquo;It is not done with
      brush or pencil; the features seem alive and, by Jove, you can actually
      see it breathe. Don't you see the clouds gliding by, and the wings
      moving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is light&mdash;it is formed by light!&rdquo; declared the other
      enthusiastically, and he ran to the wall, about six feet from the picture,
      and put his hand on a square metal box screwed to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman advanced curiously and examined the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see that tiny speck of light in the side towards the picture?
      Well, the view is thrown from this box on the wall, and it is the motion
      of the powerful light that gives apparent life to the angel. It is
      wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a commodious alcove, in a glow of pink light from above, was a
      life-sized group of musicians&mdash;statues in colored metal of a Spanish
      girl playing a mandora, an Italian with a slender calascione, a Russian
      playing his jorbon, and an African playing a banjo. Luxurious couches hung
      by spiral springs from the ceiling to a convenient height from the floor,
      and here and there lay rugs of rare beauty and great ottomans of artistic
      designs and colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to go to bed,&rdquo; proposed Thorndyke; &ldquo;we shall have plenty of time
      to see this Aladdin's land before we get away from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were two large downy beds on quaintly wrought bedsteads of brass,
      but the two captives decided to sleep together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke was the first to awaken. The lights in the candelabrum were out,
      but a gray light came in at the top and bottom of the window. He rose and
      drew the heavy curtain of one of the windows aside. He shrank back in
      astonishment.

    <h2>
      Chapter III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Thorndyke? What are you looking at?&rdquo; And the American slowly
      left the bed and approached his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke only held the curtain further back and watched Johnston's face
      as he looked through the wide plate-glass window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; ejaculated the latter as he drew nearer. It was a wondrous
      scene. The building in which they were imprisoned stood on a gentle hill
      clad in luxuriant, smoothly-cut grass and ornamented with beautiful
      flowers and plants; and below lay a splendid city&mdash;a city built on
      undulating ground with innumerable grand structures of white marble, with
      turrets, domes and pinnacles of gold. Wide streets paved in polished stone
      and bordered with lush-green grass interspersed with statues and beds and
      mounds of strange plants and flowers stretched away in front of them till
      they were lost in the dim, misty distance. Parks filled with pavilions,
      pleasure-lakes, fountains and tortuous drives and walks, dotted the
      landscape in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's breath had clouded the glass of the window, and he rubbed it
      with his handkerchief. As he did so the sash slowly, and without a
      particle of sound, slid to one side, disclosing a narrow balcony outside.
      It had a graceful balustrade, made of carved red-and-white mottled marble,
      and on the end of the balcony facing the city sat a great gold and silver
      jug, ten feet high, of rare design. The spout was formed by the body of a
      dragon with wings extended; the handle was a serpent with the extremity of
      its tail coiled around the neck of the jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air that came in at the window was fresh and dewy, and laden with the
      most entrancing odors. Thorndyke led the way out, treading very gently at
      first. Johnston followed him, too much surprised to make any comment. From
      this position, their view to the left round the corner of the building was
      widened, and new wonders appeared on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the polished stone pavements strange vehicles ran noiselessly, as if
      the wheels had cushioned tires, and the streets were crowded with an
      active, strangely-clad populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; exclaimed the American, and from a street corner they saw
      a queer-looking machine, carrying half-a-dozen passengers, rise like a
      bird with wings outspread and fly away toward the east. They watched it
      till it disappeared in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are indeed in wonderland,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;I can't make head nor
      tail of it. We were on an isolated island, the Lord only knows where, and
      have suddenly been transported to a new world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't feel at all as if we were in the world we were born in,&rdquo; returned
      Johnston. &ldquo;I feel strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wine,&rdquo; suggested the Englishman, &ldquo;you know it did wonders for us in
      that subwater thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the wine has nothing to do with it. My head never was clearer. The
      very atmosphere is peculiar. The air is invigorating, and I can't get
      enough of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the way I feel,&rdquo; was Thorndyke's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the sunlight,&rdquo; went on Johnston; &ldquo;it is gray like our dawn, but
      see how transparent it is. You can look through it for miles and miles. It
      is becoming pink in the east, the sun will soon be up, and I am curious to
      see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be up now, but we cannot see it for the hills and buildings. My
      goodness, see that!&rdquo; and the Englishman pointed to the east. A flood of
      delicate pink light was now pouring into the vast body of gray and was
      slowly driving the more sombre color toward the west. The line of
      separation was marked&mdash;so marked, indeed, that it seemed a vast,
      rose-colored billow rolling, widening and sweeping onward like a swell of
      the ocean shoreward. On it came rapidly, till the whole landscape was
      magically changed. The flowers, the trees, the grass, the waters of the
      lakes, the white buildings, the costumes of the people in the streets,
      even the sky, changed in aspect. The white clouds looked like fire-lit
      smoke, and far toward the west rolled the long line of pink still
      struggling with the gray and driving it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun now came into sight, a great bleeding ball of fire slowly rising
      above the gilded roofs in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, look at our shadows!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnston, and both men gazed at
      the balcony floor in amazement; their shadows were as clearly defined and
      black as silhouettes. &ldquo;How do you account for that?&rdquo; continued the
      American, &ldquo;I am firmly convinced that this sun is not the orb that shines
      over my native land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke laughed, but his laugh was forced. &ldquo;How absurd! and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
       He extended his hand over the balustrade into the rosy glow, and without
      concluding his remark held it back into the shadow of the window-casement.
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;there is not a particle of warmth in it. It is
      exactly the same temperature in the shade as in the light.&rdquo; He moved back
      against the wall. &ldquo;No; there is no difference; the blamed thing doesn't
      give out any warmth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston's hands were extended in the light. &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; he
      declared in awe, &ldquo;something is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment appeared from the room behind them a handsome youth,
      attired in a suit of scarlet silk that fitted his athletic figure
      perfectly. He rapped softly on the window-casement and bowed when they
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your breakfast is waiting for you,&rdquo; he announced. They followed him into
      a room adjoining the one they had occupied, and found a table holding a
      sumptuous repast. The boy gave them seats and handed them golden plates to
      eat upon. The fruits, wine and meats were very appetizing, and they ate
      with relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we are to be conducted to the palace of your king to-morrow,&rdquo;
       ventured the Englishman to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy shook his head, but made no reply, and busied himself with
      removing the dishes. As they were rising from the table, they heard
      footsteps in the hall outside. The door opened. It was Captain Tradmos,
      and he was accompanied by a tall, bearded man with a leather case under
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must undergo a medical examination,&rdquo; the captain said smilingly. &ldquo;It
      is our invariable custom, but this is by a special order from the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shuddered as he looked at the odd-looking instruments the medical
      man was taking from the case, but Thorndyke watched his movements with
      phlegmatic indifference. He stood erect; threw back his shoulders;
      expanded his massive chest and struck it with his clenched fist in
      pantomimic boastfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos smiled genially; but there was something curt and official in his
      tone when he next spoke that took the Englishman slightly aback. &ldquo;You must
      bare your breast over your heart and lungs,&rdquo; he said; and while Thorndyke
      was unbuttoning his shirt, he and the medical man went to the door and
      brought into the room a great golden bell hanging in a metallic frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was so thin and sensitive to the slightest jar or movement that,
      although it had been handled with extreme care, the captives could see
      that it was vibrating considerably, and the room was filled with a low
      metallic sound that not only affected the ear of the hearer but set every
      nerve to tingling. The medical man stopped the sound by laying his hand
      upon the bell. To a tube in the top of the bell he fastened one end of a
      rubber pipe; the other end was finished with a silver device shaped like
      the mouth-piece of a speaking tube. This he firmly pressed over the
      Englishman's heart. Thorndyke winced and bit his lip, for the strange
      thing took hold of his flesh with the tenacity of a powerful suction-pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he exclaimed playfully, but Johnston saw that he had turned pale,
      and that his face was drawn as if from pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold still!&rdquo; ordered the medical man; &ldquo;it will be over in a minute; now,
      be perfectly quiet and listen to the bell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman stood motionless, the sinews of his neck drawn and knotted,
      his eyes starting from their sockets. Thorndyke felt the rubber tube
      quiver suddenly and writhe with the slow energy of a dying snake, and then
      from the quivering bell came a low, gurgling sound like a stream of water
      being forced backward and forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos and the medical man stepped to the bell and inspected a small dial
      on its top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; gasped the Englishman, purple in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sound of your blood,&rdquo; answered Tradmos, as he removed the instrument
      from Thorndyke's flesh; &ldquo;it is as regular as mine; you are very lucky; you
      are slightly fatigued, but you will be sound in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the Englishman, but he sank into a chair, overcome
      with weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I'll take you, please,&rdquo; said the medical man, motioning Johnston to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am slightly nervous,&rdquo; apologized the latter, as he stood up and
      awkwardly fumbled the buttons of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervousness is a mental disease,&rdquo; said the man, with professional
      brusqueness; &ldquo;it has nothing to do with the body except to dominate it at
      times. If you pass your examination you may live to overcome it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American looked furtively at Thorndyke, but the head of the Englishman
      had sunk on his breast and he seemed to be asleep. Johnston had never felt
      so lonely and forsaken in his life. From his childhood he had entertained
      a secret fear that he had inherited heart disease, and like Maupassant's
      &ldquo;Coward,&rdquo; who committed suicide rather than meet a man in a duel, he had
      tried in vain to get away from the horrible, ever-present thought by
      plunging into perilous adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he felt that he would rather die than know the worst from
      the uncanny instrument that had just tortured his strong comrade till he
      was overcome with exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never felt better in my life,&rdquo; he said falteringly, but it seemed to
      him that every nerve and muscle in his frame was withering through fear.
      His tongue felt clumsy and thick and his knees were quivering as with
      ague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; ordered the physician sternly, and Johnston was further
      humiliated by having Tradmos sympathetically catch hold of his arm to
      steady him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your people are far advanced in the sciences,&rdquo; went on the physician
      coldly, &ldquo;but there are only a few out of their number who know that the
      mind governs the body and that fear is its prime enemy. Five minutes ago
      you were eating heartily and had your share of physical strength, and yet
      the mere thought that you are now to know the actual condition of your
      most vital organ has made you as weak as an infant. If you kept up this
      state of mind for a month it would kill you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; he went on, as the instrument gripped Johnston's flesh and
      the rubber tube began to twist and move as if charged with electricity.
      The American held his breath. A sound as of water being forced through
      channels that were choked, mingled with a wheezing sound like wind
      escaping from a broken bellows came from the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your frame is all right,&rdquo; said the medical man, as he released the
      trembling American, &ldquo;but you have long believed in the weakness of your
      heart and it has, on that account, become so. You must banish all fear
      from your thoughts. You perhaps know that we have a place specially
      prepared for those who are not physically sound. I am sorry that you do
      not stand a better examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos regarded the American with a look of sympathy as he gave him a
      chair and then rang a bell on the table. Thorndyke looked up sleepily, as
      an attendant entered with a couple of parcels, and glanced wonderingly at
      his friend's white face and bloodshot eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he asked; but Johnston made no reply, for the captain
      had opened the parcels and taken out two suits of silken clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put them on,&rdquo; he said, giving a suit of gray to Johnston and one of light
      blue to Thorndyke. &ldquo;We shall leave you to change your attire, and I shall
      soon come for you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the captain returned and found his prisoners ready to go
      with him. Thorndyke looked exceedingly handsome in his glossy tights,
      close-fitting sack-coat, tinsel belt and low shoes with buckles of gold.
      The natural color had come back into his cheeks, and he was exhilarated
      over the prospect of further adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so, however, with poor Johnston; his spirits had been so
      dampened by the physician's words that he could not rally from his
      despondency. His suit fitted his figure as well as that of the Englishman,
      but he could not wear it with the same hopeful grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; whispered Thorndyke, as they followed the captain through a
      long corridor, &ldquo;if we are on our way to the stake or block we are at least
      going dressed like gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside they found the streets lined with spectators eagerly waiting to
      see them pass. The men all had suits like those which had been given the
      captives, and the women wore flowing gowns like those of ancient Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the common people,&rdquo; whispered Thorndyke to Johnston, &ldquo;but did
      you ever dream of such perfect features and physiques? Every face is full
      of merriment and good cheer. I am curious to see the royalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston made no reply, for Captain Tradmos turned suddenly and faced
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand here till I return,&rdquo; he said, and he went back into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in the deuce do you think we are?&rdquo; pursued Thorndyke with a grim
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't the slightest idea,&rdquo; sighed Johnston, and he shuddered as he
      looked down the long white street with its borders of human faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke was observant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a breath of air stirring,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and yet the atmosphere
      is like impalpable delicacies to a hungry man's stomach. Look at that big
      tree, not a leaf is moving, and yet every breath I draw is as fresh as if
      it came from a mountain-top. Did you ever see such flowers as those? Look
      at that ocean of orchids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think we are a regular monkey-show,&rdquo; grumbled the American. &ldquo;Look
      how the crowd is gaping and shoving and fighting for places to see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's your legs they want to behold, old fellow. Do you know I never knew
      you had such knotty knee-joints; did you ever have rheumatism? I wish I
      had 'em; they wouldn't put me to death&mdash;they would make me the chief
      attraction in the royal museum.&rdquo; Thorndyke concluded his jest with a
      laugh, but the face of his friend did not brighten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet that medical examination meant something serious,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; and the Englishman slapped his friend playfully on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I have seen that vast crowd of well-developed people, and remember
      what that medicine man said, I have made up my mind that we are going to
      be separated.&rdquo; Poor Johnston's lip was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! but there comes the captain; put on a bold front; talk up New
      York; tell 'em about Chicago and the Fair, and ask to be allowed to ride
      in their Ferris Wheel&mdash;if they ain't got no wheel, ask 'em when the
      first train leaves town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time for jokes,&rdquo; growled Johnston, as Tradmos returned.
      Tradmos motioned to something that in the distance looked like a carriage,
      but which turned out to be a flying machine. It rose gracefully and glided
      over the ground and settled at their feet. It was large enough to seat a
      dozen people, and there was a little glass-windowed compartment at the end
      in which they could see &ldquo;the driver,&rdquo; as he was termed by Tradmos. The
      mysterious machinery was hidden in the woodwork overhead and beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; said the captain, and the door flew open as if of its own
      accord. Thorndyke went in first and was followed by the moody American.
      &ldquo;Let up on the ague,&rdquo; jested Thorndyke, nudging his friend with his elbow;
      &ldquo;if you keep on quivering like that you may shake the thing loose from its
      moorings and we'd never know what became of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston scowled, and the officer, who had overheard the remark, smiled as
      he leaned toward the window and gave some directions to the man in the
      other compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both take it rather coolly,&rdquo; he remarked to Thorndyke. &ldquo;I took a man
      and a woman over this route several years ago and both of them were in a
      dead faint; but, in fact, you have nothing to fear. We never have
      accidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as safe as a balloon, I suppose, and we are at home in them,&rdquo; said
      the Englishman, with just the hint of a swagger in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your balloons are poor, primitive things at best,&rdquo; returned Tradmos
      in his soft voice. &ldquo;They can't be compared to this mode of travel, though,
      of course, our machines would not operate in your atmosphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; impulsively asked the Englishman. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not conclude his remark, for they were rising, and both he and
      Johnston leaned apprehensively forward and looked out of one of the
      windows. Down below the long lines of people were silently waving their
      hats, scarfs and handkerchiefs as the machine swept along over their
      heads. As they rose higher the scene below widened like a great circular
      fan, and in the delicate roselight, the whole so appealed to Thorndyke's
      artistic sense that he ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious! Superb! Transcendent!&rdquo; and he directed Johnston's attention to
      the wonderful pinkish haze which lay over the view toward the west like a
      vast diaphanous web of rosy sunbeams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask why our air-ships would not operate in your atmosphere,&rdquo; said the
      captain, showing pleasure at Thorndyke's enthusiasm. &ldquo;It is simple enough
      when you have studied the climatic differences between the two countries.
      You have much to contend with&mdash;the winds, for instance, the heat and
      cold, etc.; this is the only known country where the winds are subjugated.
      I have never been in your world, but from what I have heard of it I am not
      anxious to see it. Your atmosphere and climate are so changeable and so
      diverse in different localities that I have heard your people spend much
      of their time in seeking congenial climes. I think it was a man who came
      from London that claimed he once had a cold&mdash;'a bad cold,' I think he
      called it. It was a standing joke in the royal family for a long time, and
      he heard so much about it that he tried to deny what he had said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston glanced at the speaker non-plussed, but the captain was looking
      at Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your climate is delightful here now,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;is it so long
      at a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perpetually; it is regulated every moment, and every year we perfect it
      in some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, why not? If it ever fails to be up to the usual high
      standard, it is owing to neglect of those in charge, and neglect is
      punished severely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's eyes sought those of the American incredulously. Seeing which
      Tradmos looked amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubt it,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Well, wait till you have been here longer. The
      fact is, any one born in our climate could not live in yours. The king
      experimented on a man who claimed to have only one lung, but who had two
      sound ones when he was cut open. Well, the king sent him to China, or
      America, or some such place, and he wheezed himself to death in a week by
      your clocks. The weather was too fickle for him. Our system has been
      perfected to such an extent that we live four lives to your one, and our
      fruits and vegetables are a hundred per cent. better than those in other
      countries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of your country?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke, feeling that he was
      not losing anything by his boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it located?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo; Tradmos looked out at the window for a moment as if to
      ascertain that they were going in the right direction, then he fixed his
      dark eyes on Thorndyke and asked hesitatingly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought&mdash;I&mdash;but do you know where your country is
      located?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know where this one is. We are taught everything, I think,
      except geography.&rdquo; Nothing more was said for several minutes, then an
      exclamation of admiration broke from the Englishman. The color of the
      sunlight was changing. From east to west within the entire arc of their
      observation rolled an endless billow of lavender light leaving a placid
      sea of the same color behind it. On it swept, slowly driving back the pink
      glow that had been over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you like our sunlight?&rdquo; said Tradmos, half interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw anything like it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours is, I think, the same color all day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except on rainy days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be a great bore, monotonous&mdash;too much sameness. It is white, is
      it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather&mdash;between white and yellow, I call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like our sixth hour, I suppose; this is the fourth hour of
      morning. Then come blue, yellow, green, and at noon red. The afternoon is
      divided up in the same way. The first hour is green, then follow yellow,
      blue, lavender, rose, gray and purple. Yes, I should think you would find
      yours somewhat tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can rely on it,&rdquo; said Johnston speaking for the first time and in a
      wavering voice, &ldquo;it is always there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing business at the old stand,&rdquo; laughed Thorndyke, attempting an
      Americanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a comfort, anyway,&rdquo; said the captain seriously. &ldquo;In my time
      they have had no solar trouble, but some of the old people tell horrible
      tales of a period when our sun for several days did not shine at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo; said the Englishman dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; and the early settlers had a great deal of trouble in different
      ways; but I am not at liberty to give you information on that head. It is
      the king's special pleasure to have new-comers form their own impressions,
      and he is particularly fond of noting their surprise, and, above all,
      their approval. People usually come here of their own accord through the
      influence of our secret force of agents all over the earth, but you were
      brought because you happened to drop on our island and would have found
      out too much for our good, and that red light you kept burning night and
      day might have given us trouble. There is no telling how long you could
      have kept alive on those clams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meant no offence,&rdquo; apologized Thorndyke; &ldquo;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it, I was only explaining the situation,&rdquo; interrupted the
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that bright spot to the right?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke, to change the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king's palace; that is the dome. We shall soon be there. Now, I must
      not talk to you any longer. Somebody may be watching us with glasses. I
      have taken a liking to you, and some time, when I get the opportunity, I
      shall give you some useful advice, but I must treat you very formally, at
      least till you have had audience with the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Englishman, and Tradmos stood up in the car to watch
      their progress through the circular glass of a little cupola on top.
      Thorndyke smiled at Johnston, but the American was in no pleasant mood.
      The indifference with which Tradmos had treated him had nettled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The machine was now slowly descending. A vast pile of white marble, with
      many golden domes and spires, rose between them and the earth below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the balcony on the central dome,&rdquo; ordered Tradmos through the window
      of the driver's compartment; and the adventurers felt the car sweep round
      in a curve that threw them against each other, and the next moment they
      had landed on a wide iron balcony encircling a great golden cone that
      towered hundreds of feet above them.

    <h2>
      Chapter V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the captain stiffly, for there were several guards in
      white and gold uniforms pacing to and fro on the battlement-like walls. He
      led the two adventurers through a door in the base of the dome. At first
      they were dazed by a brilliant light from above, and looking up they
      beheld a marvel of kaleidoscopic colors formed by a myriad of
      electric-lighted prisms sloping gradually from the floor to the apex of
      the dome. Thorndyke could compare it to nothing but a stupendous diamond,
      the very heart of which the eye penetrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at it now,&rdquo; advised Tradmos, in an undertone; &ldquo;it was
      constructed to be seen from below, and to light the great rotunda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mutely the captives obeyed. At every turn they were greeted with a new
      wonder. The captain now led them round a narrow balcony on the inside of
      the vast dome, and, looking over the railing down below, they saw a vast
      tessellated pavement made of polished stones of various and brilliant
      colors and so artistically arranged that, from where they stood, lifelike
      pictures of landscapes seemed to rise to meet the vision wherever the eye
      rested. Statues of white marble, gold and bronze were placed here and
      there, and, in squares of living green, fountains threw up streams of
      crystal water. Tradmos paused for them to look down and smiled at their
      evident admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it down there?&rdquo; Thorndyke ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over a thousand feet,&rdquo; replied Tradmos. &ldquo;Look across opposite and you
      will see that there are fifty floors beneath us, and each floor has a
      balcony like this overlooking the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the sound that comes up from below?&rdquo; asked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the voices of the people and their footsteps on the stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see them? Your eyes are dazzled by the light; I ought to have
      warned you against looking up into the dome. The people are down there; do
      the views in the pavement not look a little blurred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you will look more closely you will see that it is a multitude
      of people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the Englishman, and he became deeply absorbed
      in the contemplation of the rarest sight he had ever seen. As he looked
      closely he noticed a black spot growing larger and nearer, and he glanced
      inquiringly at the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an elevator. There are a great many of them used in the palace, but
      none have happened to rise as high as this since we came. The one you see
      is coming for us.&rdquo; The next moment the strange vehicle was floating toward
      them. The captain opened the door and preceded the captives into the
      interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The royal audience chamber,&rdquo; he said, carelessly, to the driver behind
      the glass of the adjoining compartment, and down they floated as lightly
      as a bubble&mdash;down past balcony after balcony, laden with moving
      throngs, until they alighted in a great conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near them was a tall fountain the water of which was playing weird music
      on great bells of glass, some of which hung in the fountain's stream and
      others rose and fell, giving forth strange, submerged tones in the foaming
      basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a new invention recently placed here by the king's son who is a
      musical genius,&rdquo; explained Tradmos. &ldquo;You will be astonished at some of his
      inventions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led them, as if to avoid the great crowds that they could now hear on
      all sides, down a long vista of palms, the branches of which met over
      their heads, to the wide door of the audience chamber. A party of men
      dressed in uniforms of white silk with gold and silver ornaments bowed
      before the captain and made way for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captives now found themselves in the most splendid and spacious room
      they had ever seen, at the far end of which was a long dais and on it an
      elaborate throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be obliged to leave you when the king comes,&rdquo; said Tradmos to
      Thorndyke, &ldquo;but I shall hope to see you again. Don't forget my name and
      rank, for I may send you a message some time that may aid you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank
      you,&rdquo; replied the Englishman, and then as a throng of beautiful young
      women came from a room on the side and gathered about the throne he added
      inquisitively: &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wives and daughters of the king and the wives of the princes,&rdquo; was
      the cautious answer, &ldquo;but don't look at any one of them closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how a fellow can help it; they are ravishingly beautiful,
      don't you think so, Johnston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool,&rdquo; snapped the American, &ldquo;don't you know enough to hold
      your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos smiled as if amused, and when he had shown them to seats near the
      great golden throne, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are till the king sends for you, and then go and kneel
      before the throne. Do not rise till he bids you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captives thanked him and the captain turned away. The eyes of all the
      royal party now rested on the strangers, and it was hard for them to
      appear unconscious of it. A great crowd was slowly filling the room and an
      orchestra in a balcony on the left of the dais began to make delightful
      music on instruments the strangers had never before seen. After an
      entrancing prelude a sound of singing was heard, and far up in a grand
      dome, lighted like the one the captives had just admired over the central
      court of the palace, they saw a bevy of maidens, robed in white, moving
      about in mid-air, apparently unsupported by anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth is that done?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; returned Johnston, speaking more freely now that the
      captain had gone. &ldquo;I am not surprised at anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their voices are exquisite, and that orchestra&mdash;a Boston symphony
      concert couldn't be compared to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes the sunlight again,&rdquo; cried Johnston, &ldquo;by Jove, it is blue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The transition was sublime. They seemed transported to some other scene.
      The great multitude, the elegantly-dressed attendants about the throne,
      the courtiers, the beautiful women, all seemed to change in appearance; on
      the view through the wide doors leading to the conservatory, and the great
      swarming court beyond, the soft blue light fell like a filmy veil of
      enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ahead of our clocks, anyway,&rdquo; jested Thorndyke. &ldquo;Any child that can
      count on its fingers could tell that this is the fifth hour of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music grew louder; there was a harmonious blare of mighty trumpets,
      the clang of gongs and cymbals, and then the music softened till it could
      scarcely be heard. There was commotion about the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was coming. Every person on the dais stood motionless, expectant.
      A page drew aside the rich curtain from a door on the right, and an old
      man, wearing a robe of scarlet ornamented with jewels and a crown set with
      sparkling gems, entered and seated himself on the throne. The music sank
      lower; so soft did it become that the tinkling bells of the great fountain
      outside could be heard throughout the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king bowed to the throng on the dais and spoke a few words to a
      courtier who advanced as he sat down. The courtier must have spoken of
      them, for the king at once looked down at Johnston and Thorn-dyke and
      nodded his head. The courtier spoke to a page, and the youth left the dais
      and came toward the captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in for it,&rdquo; cautioned Thorndyke, &ldquo;now don't be afraid of your
      shadow; we'll come out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has sent for you,&rdquo; said the page, the next instant. &ldquo;Go to the
      throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were the cynosure of the entire room as they went up the carpeted
      steps of the dais and knelt before the king.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise!&rdquo; commanded the king, in a deep, well-modulated voice, and when they
      had arisen he inspected them critically, his eyes lingering on Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you take life easily; you have a jovial countenance,&rdquo; he
      said cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke returned his smile and at once felt at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use in taking it any other way,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it doesn't amount
      to much at best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; returned the king, playing with the jewels on his robe,
      &ldquo;that is because you have been reared as you have&mdash;in your
      unsystematic world. Here we make life a serious study. It is our object to
      assist nature in all things. The efforts of your people amount to nothing
      because they are not carried far enough. Your scientists are dreaming
      idiots. They are continually groping after the ideal and doing nothing
      with the positive. It was for us to carry out everything to perfection.
      Show me where we can make a single improvement and you shall become a
      prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my life depended on that, my head would be off this instant,&rdquo; was the
      quick-witted reply of the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This so pleased the king that he laughed till he shook. &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; he
      smiled; &ldquo;so you like our country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely charmed; my friend (Thorndyke was determined to bring his
      companion into favor, if possible) and I have been in raptures ever since
      we rose this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of pleasure crossed the face of the king. &ldquo;You have not seen half
      of our wonders yet. I confess that I am pleased with you, sir. The
      majority of people who are brought here are so frightened that they grow
      morbid and desirous to return to their own countries as soon as they learn
      that such a thing is out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's stout heart suffered a sudden pang at the words, but he did
      not change countenance in the slightest, for the king was closely watching
      the effect of his announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; went on the ruler, gratified by the indifference of the
      Englishman, &ldquo;of course, it could not be done. No one, outside of a few of
      the royal family and our trusted agents, has ever left us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see how any one could be so unappreciative as to want to go,&rdquo;
       answered Thorndyke, with a coolness that surprised even Johnston. &ldquo;I have
      travelled in all countries under the sun&mdash;the sun I was born under&mdash;and
      got so bored with them that my friend and myself took to ballooning for
      diversion; but here, there is a delightful surprise at every turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told you were aeronauts,&rdquo; returned the ruler, deigning to cast a
      glance at the silent Johnston, who stood with eyes downcast, &ldquo;and I
      confess that it interested me in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture a most beautiful girl glided through the curtains at the
      back of the throne and came impulsively toward the king. Her brown hair
      fell in rich masses on her bare shoulders; her eyes were large, deep and
      brown, and her skin was exquisitely fine in texture and color; her dress
      was artistic and well suited to her lithe figure. She held an instrument
      resembling a lute in her hands, and stopped suddenly when she noticed that
      the king was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my daughter, the Princess Bernardino,&rdquo; explained the king, as he
      heard her light step and turned toward her; &ldquo;she shall sing for you, and,
      yes (nodding to her) you shall dance also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she took her position on a great rug in front of the throne, she kept
      her eyes on the handsome Englishman as if fascinated by his appearance.
      Thorndyke's heart beat quickly; the blood mantled his face and he stood
      entranced as she touched the resonant strings with her white fingers and
      began to play and sing. An innocent, artless smile parted her lips from
      her matchless teeth, and her face glowed with inspiration. Far above in
      the nooks and crannies of the vast dome, with its divergent corridors and
      arcades, the faint echoes of her voice seemed to reply to her during the
      pauses in her song. Then she ceased singing and to the far-away and yet
      distinct accompaniment of some stringed instrument in the orchestra, she
      began to dance. Holding her instrument in a graceful fashion against her
      shoulder as one holds a violin, and with her flowing white gown caught in
      the other hand, she bowed and smiled and instantly seemed transformed.
      From the statuesque and dreamy singer she became a marvel of graceful
      motion. To and fro she swept from end to end of the great rug, her tiny
      feet and slim ankles tripping so lightly that she seemed to move without
      support through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke stood as if spell-bound, for, at every turn, as if seeking his
      approval, she glanced at him inquiringly. When she finished she stood for
      a moment in the centre of the rug panting, her beautiful bosom, beneath
      its filmy covering of lace, gently rising and falling. Then, asking her
      father's consent with a mute glance, she ran forward impulsively, and,
      kneeling at Thorndyke's feet, she took his hand and pressed it to her
      lips. And rising, suffused with blushes, she tripped from the dais and
      disappeared behind the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned as he looked after her. &ldquo;It is a mark of preference,&rdquo; he
      said coldly. &ldquo;It is one of our customs for a dancer or singer to favor
      some one of her spectators in that way. My daughter evidently mistook you
      for an ambassador from one of my provinces, but it does not matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is wonderfully beautiful,&rdquo; replied the tactful Englishman, pretending
      not to be flattered by the notice of the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think our people fine looking as a rule?&rdquo; asked the king, to
      change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly; I never imagined such a race existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the king was pleased. &ldquo;That is one of the objects of our system.
      Generation after generation we improve mentally and physically. We are the
      only people who have ever attempted to thoroughly study the science of
      living. Your medical men may be numbered by the million; your remedies for
      your ills change daily; what you say is good for the health to-day is
      to-morrow believed to be poison; to-day you try to make blood to give
      strength, and half a century ago you believed in taking it from the
      weakest of your patients. With all this fuss over health, you will think
      nothing of allowing the son of a man who died with a loathsome hereditary
      disease to marry a woman whose family has never had a taint of blood. Here
      no such thing is thought of. To begin with, no person who is not
      thoroughly sound can remain with us. Every heart-beat is heard by our
      medical men and every vein is transparent. You see evidences of the
      benefit of our system in the men and women around you. All our
      conveniences, the excellence of our products, our great inventions are the
      result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wondering about the size of your country,&rdquo; ventured Thorndyke
      cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled. &ldquo;That will be one of the things for you to discover
      later,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;But this, the City of Moron, is the capital; our
      provinces, farming lands, smaller cities, towns and hamlets lie around us.
      Come with me and I will show you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand and dismissed a number of courtiers who were waiting to
      be called, and rose from the throne and led the two captives into a large
      apartment adjoining the throne-room. Here they found six men in blue
      uniforms looking into a large circular mirror on a table. They all bowed
      and moved aside as the king approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men are the municipal police,&rdquo; explained the king, resting his hand
      on the gold frame of the glass; &ldquo;they are watching the city.&rdquo; And when the
      strangers drew nearer they were surprised to see reflected, in the deeply
      concave glass, the entire city in miniature; its streets, parks, public
      buildings, and moving populace. And what seemed to be the most remarkable
      feature of the invention was, that the instant the eye rested on any
      particular portion of the whole that part was at once magnified so that
      every detail of it was clearly observable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an improvement on your police system,&rdquo; continued the king. &ldquo;No
      sooner does anything go wrong than a red signal is given on the spot of
      the trouble and the attention of these officers is immediately called to
      it. A flying machine is sent out and the offender is brought to the police
      station; but trouble of any nature rarely occurs, and the duties of our
      police are merely nominal; my people live in thorough harmony. Now, come
      with me and I will give you an idea of the surrounding country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the king spoke he led them into a circular room, the roof of which was
      of white glass, and the walls were lined with large mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our general observatory from which every part of Alpha can be
      seen,&rdquo; said the king with a touch of pride in his tone. &ldquo;Look at the
      mirror in front of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did as he requested, and at first saw nothing; but, as he went to a
      stone table in the centre of the room and touched an electric button, a
      grand view of green fields, forests, streams, lakes and farm-houses
      flashed upon the mirror. The king laughed at their surprise and touched
      another button. As he did so the scene shifted gradually; the landscapes
      ran by like a panorama. A pretty village came into sight, and passed; then
      a larger town and still a larger; then fields, hills and valleys and
      forests of giant trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that way all over my kingdom,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;in an hour I can
      inspect it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is it done?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke, forgetting himself in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through a telescopic invention, aided by electricity and the clearness of
      our atmosphere,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;It would take too long to go into the
      details. The views, however, are reflected to this point from various
      observatories throughout the land. Such a system would be impossible in
      any other country on account of the clouds and atmospheric changes; but
      here we control everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; returned the Englishman, &ldquo;that green fields lie beside
      ripening ones and those in which the grain is being harvested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no change of seasons,&rdquo; answered the king. &ldquo;Change of seasons may
      be according to nature, but it is in the province of man's intellect to
      improve on nature. But I must leave you now; I shall summon you again when
      I have the leisure to continue our conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; asked Johnston, as the king disappeared
      behind a curtain in the direction of the audience chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it up; I only know that the old fellow's daughter, the Princess
      Bernardino is the most beautiful, the most bewitching creature that ever
      breathed. Did you notice her eyes and form? Great heavens! was there ever
      such a vision of human loveliness? Her grace, her voice, her glances drove
      me wild with delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dead gone,&rdquo; grumbled the American despondently; &ldquo;we'll never get
      away from here in the world. I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave up all hope in that direction some time ago,&rdquo; said Thorndyke; &ldquo;and
      why should we care? We were awfully bored with life before we came; for my
      part I'd as soon end mine up here as anywhere else. Besides, didn't his
      majesty say that they live longer under his system than we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't take stock in all he says,&rdquo; growled the American; &ldquo;he talks like
      a Chicago real estate agent who wants to sell a lot. Why doesn't he chop
      off our heads and be done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke burst into a jovial laugh. &ldquo;You are coming round all right; that
      is the first joke you have got off since we came here; his royal Nibs may
      need a court-jester and give you a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes that blamed sunlight again,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnston, grasping his
      companion's arm, &ldquo;don't you see it changing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and this time it is white, like old Sol's natural smile; but isn't
      it clear? It seems to me that I could see to the end of the earth in that
      light. I want to know how he does it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How who does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the king, of course, it is his work&mdash;some sort of invention;
      but we must keep civil tongues in our heads when we are dealing with a man
      who can color the very light of the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking back toward the great rotunda, and, as they entered the
      conservatory, the crowds of men and women stared at them curiously. They
      had paused to inspect the statue of a massive stone dragon when a young
      officer in glittering uniform approached and addressed Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he said simply; &ldquo;it is the king's command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American started and looked at Thorndyke apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;don't hesitate an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Johnston had turned white. He held out his hand to Thorndyke,
      &ldquo;Shake,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, not intended for the ears of the officer,
      &ldquo;I don't believe that we shall meet again. I felt that we were to be
      parted ever since that medical examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's face had altered; an angry flush came in his face and his eyes
      flashed, but with an effort he controlled himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, don't be silly. I shall wait for you round here; if there is
      any foul play I shall make some one suffer for it. You can depend on me to
      the end; we are hand in hand in this adventure, old man.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnston followed his guide to a flying machine outside. He hesitated an
      instant, as the officer was holding the door open, and looked back toward
      the conservatory; but he could not see Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; he asked desperately. But the officer did not
      seem to hear the question. He was motioning to a tall man of athletic
      build who wore a dark blue uniform and who came hastily forward and pushed
      the American into the machine. Through the open door Johnston saw
      Thorndyke's anxious face as the Englishman emerged from the conservatory
      and strode toward them. The two officers entered and closed the glass
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the machine rose and Johnston's spirits sank as they shot upward and
      floated easily over the humming crowd into the free white light above the
      smokeless city. The poor captive leaned on the window-sill and looked out.
      There was no breeze, and no current of air except that caused by their
      rapid passage through the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up, up, they went, till the city seemed a blur of mingled white and gray,
      and then the color below changed to a vague blue as they flew over the
      fields of the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first officer took a glass and a decanter from a receptacle under a
      seat, and, pouring a little red fluid into the glass, offered it to the
      American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will put you to sleep for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to be drugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The journey will try your nerves. It is harmless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want it; if I take it, you will have to pour it down my throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer smiled as he put the glass and decanter away. Faster and
      faster flew the machine. They had to put the window down, for the current
      of air had become too strong and cool to be pleasant. The color of the
      sunlight changed to green, and then at noon, from the zenith, a glorious
      red light shimmered down and veiled the earth with such a beautiful
      translucent haze that the poor American for a moment almost forgot his
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon came on. The sunlight became successively green, white,
      blue, lavender, rose and gray. The sun was no longer in sight and the gray
      in the west was darkening into purple, the last hour of the day. Night was
      at hand. Johnston's limbs were growing stiff from inaction, and he had a
      strong desire to speak or to hear one of the officers say something, but
      they were dozing in their respective corners. The moon had risen and hung
      far out in space overhead, but they seemed to be leaving it behind. Later
      he felt sure of this, for its light gradually became dimmer and dimmer
      till at last they were in total darkness&mdash;darkness pierced only by
      the powerful search-light which threw its dazzling, trumpet-shaped rays
      far ahead. But, search as he would in the direction they were going, the
      unfortunate American could see nothing but the ever-receding wall of
      blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they began to descend. The officers awoke and stretched
      themselves and yawned. One of them opened the window and Johnston heard a
      far-off, roaring sound like that of a multitude of skaters on a vast sheet
      of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down, down, they dropped. Johnston's heart was in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The machine suddenly slackened in its speed and then hung poised in
      mid-air. The rays of the search-light were directed downward and slowly
      shifted from point to point. Looking down, the American caught glimpses of
      rugged rocks, sharp cliffs and yawning chasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; asked the first officer, through a speaking-tube, of the
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good landing!&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go down.&rdquo; And a moment later the machine settled on the uneven
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same officer opened the door, and gently pushed Johnston out. Johnston
      expected them to follow him, but the door of the machine closed behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand out of the way,&rdquo; cried out the officer through the window; &ldquo;you may
      get struck as we rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Johnston obeyed. There was a sound of escaping air from
      beneath the machine, a fierce commotion in the atmosphere which sucked him
      toward the machine, and then the dazzling search-light blinded him, as the
      air-ship bounded upward and sailed back over the course it had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston stood paralyzed with fear. &ldquo;My God, this is awful!&rdquo; he exclaimed
      in terror, and his knees gave way beneath him and he sank to the rock.
      &ldquo;They have left me here to starve in this hellish darkness!&rdquo; He remained
      there for a moment, his face covered with his hands, then he sprang up
      desperately, and started to grope through the darkness, he knew not
      whither. He stumbled at almost every step, and ran against boulders which
      bruised his hands and face, and went on till his strength was gone. Then
      he paused and looked back toward the direction from which he had come. It
      seemed to him that he could see the straight line of mighty black wall
      above which there was a faint appearance of light. A lump rose in the
      throat of the poor fellow, and tears sprang into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was that? Surely it was a sound. It could not have been the wind,
      for the air was perfectly still. The sound was repeated. It was like the
      moaning of a human voice far away in the dark. Could it be some one in
      distress, some poor unfortunate, banished being, like himself? Again he
      heard the sound, and this time, it was like the voice of some one talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; shouted the American, and a cold shudder went over him at the
      sound of his own husky voice. There was a dead silence, then, like an echo
      of his own cry, faintly came the word, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filled with superstitious fear, the American cautiously groped toward the
      sound. &ldquo;Hello, there, who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo; said the voice, and it was now much nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston plunged forward precipitately. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; and a human form loomed up before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment neither spoke, then the strange figure said: &ldquo;I thought at
      first that you were some one sent to rescue me, but I see you are alone&mdash;damned
      like myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; replied Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did they bring you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a moment ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, it is awful! A week ago I did not dream of such a fate as this. I
      had enemies. The medical men were bribed to vote against me. Am I not
      strong? Am I not muscular? Feel my arms and thighs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out an arm and Johnston felt of it. The muscles were like stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are right; but they reported that there was a taint in my blood.
      I was to marry Lallio, the most beautiful creature in our village&mdash;Madryl,
      you know, the nearest hamlet to the home of the Sun. I was rich, and the
      best farmer there. But Lyngale wanted her. She hated him and spat at him
      when he spoke against me. He proved by others that my lungs were weak, and
      showed them the blood of a slain dog in my fields that they said had come
      from my lungs. Ah, they were curs! My lungs weak! Strike my chest with all
      your might. Does it not sound like the king's thunder? Strike, I say!&rdquo; and
      as the enfeebled American struck his bare breast he cried:&mdash;&ldquo;Harder,
      harder! Pooh, you are a child, see this, and this,&rdquo; and he emphasized his
      words with thunderous blows on his resounding chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it has been so for a century,&rdquo; he panted; &ldquo;hundreds have been
      unjustly buried alive here. The king thinks it is not murder because they
      die of starvation. I have stumbled over the bones of giants here in the
      dark lands, and have met dying men that are stronger than the king's
      athletes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, are there others here?&rdquo; gasped the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian was silent in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where did you come from?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From New York City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know of it, and yet I thought I knew of all the places inside the
      great endless wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was mystified in his turn. &ldquo;It is not in your country&mdash;your
      world, or whatever you call it. It is far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, under the white sun! In the 'Ocean Country,' and the world of fierce
      winds and disease. And you are from there. I had heard of it before they
      banished me; but two days since I came across a dying man, away over
      there. He was huddled against the wall, and had fallen and killed himself
      in his efforts to climb back to food and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him die. He told me that he had come from your land when he was a
      child. His trouble was the lungs and he had fallen off to a skeleton. He
      talked to me of your wide ocean land. Is it, indeed so great? And has it
      no walls about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is surrounded by water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; and, after a pause, in which Johnston could hear
      the great fellow's heart beating, he continued; &ldquo;That must be the Heaven
      the man spoke about. And beyond the water is it always dark like this, and
      do they banish people there as the king has us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; beyond are other countries. But is there no chance for us to escape
      from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian laughed bitterly. &ldquo;None. What were you banished for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold out your arm. There,&rdquo; as he grasped Johnston's arm in a clasp of
      iron, &ldquo;I see; you are undeveloped, unfit&mdash;none but the healthy and
      strong are allowed to live in Alpha. It is right, of course; but it is
      hard to bear. But I must lie down. I am wearied with constant rambling. I
      am nervous too. I fell asleep awhile ago and dreamt I heard all my friends
      in a great clamoring body calling my name, 'Branasko!' and then I awoke
      and cried for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he sank with a sigh to the ground and rested his head on his
      elbows and knees and seemed asleep. The American sat down beside him, and,
      for a long time, neither spoke. Branasko broke the silence; he awoke with
      a start and eyed his companion in sleepy wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh, I dreamt again,&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;are you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Johnston's reply. &ldquo;I am hungry and thirsty and cannot sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, but we must wait till it is lighter, then we can go in search of
      food. When I was a boy I learned to catch fish in pools with my hands and
      it has prolonged my life here. When the light comes again, I shall show
      you how I do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the day does break? I thought it was eternally dark here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not get very light, because we are behind the sun; but it is
      lighter than now, for we get the sun's reflection, enough at least to keep
      us from falling into the chasms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko lowered his head to his knees and slept again, but the American,
      though wearied, was wakeful. Several hours passed. The Alphian was
      sleeping soundly, his breathing was very heavy and he had rolled down on
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away in the east the darkness gradually faded into purple, and then
      into gray, and slowly hints of pink appeared in the skies. It was dawn.
      Johnston touched his companion. The man awoke and looked at him from his
      great swollen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is day,&rdquo; he yawned, rising and stretching himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the sun is not in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it shows itself only in the middle of the day, and then but for a few
      minutes. We must go now and search for food. I will show you how to catch
      the eyeless fish in the black caverns over there.&rdquo; And he led the American
      into the blackness behind them. Every now and then, as they stumbled
      along, Johnston would look longingly back toward the faint pink light that
      shone above the high black wall. But Branasko hastened on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came to the edge of a black chasm and the American was
      filled with awe, for, from the seemingly fathomless depths, came a great
      roaring sound like that of a mighty wind and the air that came from it was
      hot, though pure and free from the odor of gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are everywhere,&rdquo; answered Branasko, &ldquo;if it were not for their hot
      breathing the Land of the Changing Sun would be cold and damp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sun does not give out heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, I have never thought much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American was mystified, but he did not question farther, for Branasko
      was carefully lowering himself into the hot gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we must cross it to reach the caves. I will guide
      you. I have been over this way before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can we stand the heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; when we get used to it, it is invigorating. I perspire in
      streams, but I feel better afterward. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko's head only was above the ground. &ldquo;I am standing on a ledge,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Get down beside me. Fear nothing. It is solid; besides, what does
      it matter? You can die but once, and it would really be better to fall
      down there into the internal fires than to starve slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shuddered convulsively as he let himself down beside Branasko.
      His foot dislodged a stone. With a crash it fell upon a lower ledge and
      bounded off and went whizzing down into the depths. Both men listened.
      They heard the stone bounding from ledge to ledge till the sound was lost
      in the internal roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mighty deep,&rdquo; said Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but follow me; we cannot stop here; we must go along this ledge till
      we get to the point where the chasm is narrow enough to jump across. I
      have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American held to his companion with one hand and the rock with the
      other, and they slowly made their way along the narrow ledge, pausing
      every now and then to rest. At every step the path grew more perilous and
      narrower, and the cliff on their left rose higher and higher, till the
      reflected light of the sun had entirely disappeared. At certain points the
      hot wind dashed upon them as furiously as the whirling mist in 'The Cave
      of Winds' at Niagara Falls. Once Johnston's foot slipped and he fell, but
      was drawn back to safety by the strong arm of the Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful; hold to the cliff's face,&rdquo; warned Branasko indifferently, and
      he moved onward as if nothing unusual had occurred. Presently they reached
      a point where a narrow boulder jutted out over the chasm toward the
      opposite side, and Branasko cautiously crawled out upon it. When he had
      got to its end, Johnston could not see him in the gloom, but his voice
      came to him out of the roaring of the chasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see the other side, and am going to jump.&rdquo; An instant later, the
      American heard the clatter of the Alphian's shoes on the rock, and his
      grunt of satisfaction. Then Branasko called out: &ldquo;Come on; crawl out till
      you feel the end of the rock, and then you can see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In great trepidation the American slowly crawled out on the narrow rock.
      Below him yawned the hot darkness, above hung that black ominous canopy of
      nothingness. Slowly he advanced on hands and knees, every moment feeling
      the sharp rock growing narrower, till finally he reached the end. He
      looked ahead. He could but faintly see the ledge and Branasko's tall form
      silhouetted upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, this is where you have to alight,&rdquo; cried the Alphian. &ldquo;Jump, I will
      catch you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall topple over when I stand up,&rdquo; replied the American.
      &ldquo;The rock is narrow and my head is already swimming. I fear I cannot reach
      you. It is no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; exclaimed Branasko. &ldquo;Stand up quickly, and jump at once. Don't
      stop to think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston obeyed. He felt his feet firmly braced on the rock and he sprang
      toward the opposite ledge with all his might. Branasko caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;There is another place, we must jump again. It is
      further on.&rdquo; Along this ledge they went for some distance, Branasko
      leading the way and holding the arm of the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here we are, the chasm is a little wider, but the ledge on the other
      side is broader.&rdquo; As he spoke he released Johnston's arm and prepared to
      jump. He filled his lungs two or three times. But he seemed to hesitate.
      &ldquo;Pshaw, watching you back there has made me nervous. I never cared before.
      If I should happen to fall, go back to where we met, it is safer there
      without a guide than here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word Branasko hurled himself forward. Johnston held his
      breath in horror, for Branasko's foot had slipped as he jumped. The
      Alphian had struck the opposite ledge, but not with his feet, as he
      intended. He clutched it with his hands and hung there for a moment,
      struggling to get a foothold in the emptiness beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, I am falling; I can hold no longer!&rdquo; And Johnston,&mdash;too
      terrified to reply,&mdash;heard the poor fellow's hands slipping from the
      rock, causing a quantity of loose stones to go rattling down below. With a
      low cry Branasko fell. An instant later Johnston heard him strike the
      ledge beneath, and heard him cry out in pain. Then all was still except
      the echoes of Branasko's cry, which bounded and rebounded from side to
      side of the chasm, and grew fainter and fainter, till it was submerged in
      the roaring below. Then there was a rattle of stones, and Branasko's voice
      sounded: &ldquo;A narrow escape!&rdquo; he said faintly. &ldquo;I am on another ledge&rdquo;&mdash;then
      after a slight pause, &ldquo;it is much wider, I don't know how wide. Are you
      listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Simply knocked the breath out of me for a moment. There is a
      cave behind me, and (for a moment there was silence) I can see a light
      ahead in the cave. I think it must be the reflection of the internal fire.
      Come down to me and we will explore the cavern, and see where the light
      comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't get down there!&rdquo; shouted Johnston, to make himself heard above a
      sudden increase in the roaring in the chasm, &ldquo;there is no way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; came from the Alphian. &ldquo;This ledge seems to incline
      upward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston stood perfectly motionless, afraid to move from the ledge either
      to right or to left, and heard Branasko's footsteps along the rock
      beneath. &ldquo;All right so far,&rdquo; he called up, and his voice showed that he
      had gone to a considerable distance to the left, &ldquo;the ledge seems to be
      still leading gradually upward. I think I can reach you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes passed. The lone American could no longer hear Branasko's
      footsteps. Johnston was becoming uneasy and the hot air was causing his
      head to swim. He was thinking of trying to retrace his footsteps to a
      place of more security when he heard footsteps, and then the cheery voice
      of Branasko nearly opposite him across the chasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well; I have discovered a good pathway down to the cave, and a pool
      of fish besides. I have saved some for you. I was so hungry I had to eat.
      Now, you must jump over to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; declared the American. &ldquo;I cannot jump so far; besides, you
      failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko laughed. &ldquo;I did not leap in the right direction. It is this point
      on which I am now standing that I should have tried to reach. Come, I will
      catch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston could not bear to be considered cowardly, so he stepped to the
      verge of the chasm and prepared to jump. His head felt more dizzy as he
      thought of the fathomless depths beneath, and the rush of hot air up the
      side of the cliff took his breath away, but he braced himself and said
      calmly: &ldquo;All right, I am coming.&rdquo; The next instant he sprang forward.
      Branasko caught him into his arms and they both rolled back on the level
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried the Alphian, trying to catch his breath, which Johnston had
      knocked out of him by the fall. &ldquo;You did better than I; you are lighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we go now?&rdquo; asked Johnston, regaining his feet and feeling of
      his legs and arms to see if he had broken any bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down this winding path to the place where I saw that light. I want to
      understand it. But you must first eat this fish. It is delicious. They are
      swarming in the pools below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And water?&rdquo; said Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An abundance of it, and as cold as ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Branasko preceded him down the tortuous path, Johnston ate the raw fish
      eagerly. Presently they came to a deep pool of water, and both men threw
      themselves down on their stomachs and drank freely. After this they
      proceeded slowly for several hundred yards, and finally reached the
      entrance to the cave in which Branasko had seen the light. At that
      distance it looked like the light of some great conflagration reflected
      from the face of a cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the cave and made good progress toward the light, for it
      showed them the dangerous fissures, sharp boulders and stalactites. They
      had walked along in silence for several minutes when the Alphian stopped
      abruptly and turned to his companion. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked
      Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot come from the internal fires,&rdquo; replied Branasko, &ldquo;for the
      atmosphere grows cooler as we get nearer the light and away from the
      chasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was too much puzzled to formulate a reply, and he simply waited
      for the Alphian to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go on,&rdquo; said Branasko; and in his tone and hesitating manner
      Johnston detected the first appearance of superstitious fear that he had
      seen in the brawny Alphian.

      Chapter VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Thorndyke watched the flying machine that was bearing his friend away a
      genuine feeling of pity went over him. Poor Johnston! He had been haunted
      all day with the belief that he was to meet with some misfortune from
      which Thorndyke was to be spared, and Thorndyke had ridiculed his fears.
      When the air-ship had become a mere speck in the sky, the Englishman
      turned back into the palace and strolled about in the vast crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handsome young man in uniform approached and touched his hat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the comrade of the fellow they are just sending away?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Where are they taking him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the 'Barrens,' of course; where do you suppose they would take such a
      man? He couldn't pass his examination. You are not a great physical
      success yourself, but they say you pleased the king with your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Barrens,&rdquo; repeated Thorndyke, too much concerned over the fate of
      his comrade to notice the speaker's tone of contempt; &ldquo;what are they,
      where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian officer changed countenance, as he looked him over with
      widening eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your accent is strange; are you from the other world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&mdash;this is a new one to me at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world of endless oceans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the unchanging sun&mdash;forever white and&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but where the devil is the Barrens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind the sun, beyond the great endless wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they intend to put him to death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that would be&mdash;what do you call it? murder; they will simply
      leave him there to die of his own accord. And the king is right. I never
      saw such a weakling. He would taint our whole race with his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Thorndyke abruptly turned from the officer and hastened
      toward the apartment of the king. He would demand the return of poor
      Johnston or kill the king if his demand was not granted. In his haste and
      perturbation, however, he lost his way and wandered into a part of the
      palace he had not seen. At every step he was more and more impressed with
      the magnificent proportions of the structure and the grandeur of
      everything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing hurriedly through a large hall he saw an assemblage of beautiful
      women and handsome men dancing to the music of a great orchestra. Further
      on&mdash;in a great court&mdash;a regiment of soldiers were drilling,
      their rapid evolutions making no more sound than if they were moving in
      mid-air. In another room he saw a great body of men, women and children in
      vari-colored suits bathing in a pool of rose-colored, perfumed water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing on when a woman, closely veiled and simply dressed, touched
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be watchful and follow me,&rdquo; she said, in a low, guarded tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the Englishman bounded and his blood rushed to his face, for
      the speaker was the Princess Bernardino. She did not pause, but glided on
      into the shade of a great palm tree, and, behind a row of thick-growing
      ferns of great height and thickness, she waited for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her veil as he approached and looked at him from her deep
      brown eyes in great concern. He stood spell-bound under the witchery of
      her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to warn you, Prince,&rdquo; she said, and her soft musical voice set
      every nerve in Thorndyke's body to tingling with delight. &ldquo;My father has
      banished the faithful slave that you love, but you must not show the anger
      that you feel, else he will kill you. You must be exceedingly cautious if
      you would save him. My father would punish me severely if he knew that I
      had sought you in this way. I was obliged to come in disguise; this dress
      belongs to my most trusted maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you came for my sake?&rdquo; blurted out the Englishman, much embarrassed;
      &ldquo;I am not worthy of such a high honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and tears rose in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Prince, don't speak to me so! You are far above me. I am weak. I know
      nothing. I never cared for other men than the king and my brothers till I
      saw you today, but now I would willingly be your slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am yours forever, and an humble one,&rdquo; bowed the courteous Englishman.
      &ldquo;The moment I saw you at the throne of your father my heart went out to
      you. You wound it up in your music and trampled it under your dancing
      feet. I have been over the whole world, and you are the loveliest creature
      in it. It is because I saw you, because you are here, that I do not want
      to leave your country. They may do as they will with me if they only will
      let me see you now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess was deeply moved. The blood rushed to her face and beautified
      it. Her eyes fell beneath his admiring glance. Thorndyke could not
      restrain himself. He caught her slender hand and pressed it passionately
      to his lips, and she made only a slight effort to prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your obedient slave; what shall I do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not try to rescue him now,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I shall come to you
      again when we are not watched&mdash;you can know me by this dress. There
      is no need for great haste, he could live in the Barrens several days; I
      shall try to think of some way to save him, though such a thing has never
      been done&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps were heard on the other side of the row of ferns. A man was
      passing and others soon followed him. The bathers were leaving the great
      pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave you now,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If the king honors you again by
      talking of his kingdom, continue to act as you did; your fearlessness and
      good humor have pleased him greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I not persuade him to bring Johnston back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that would be impossible; those who are pronounced physically unfit
      are obliged to die. It has been a law for a long time; you must not count
      on that. I have, however, another plan, but I cannot tell you of it now,
      for they may miss me and wonder where I am, and then, too, my father may
      be looking for you. He will naturally desire to see you soon again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bowing, she turned away and passed on toward the apartments of the king,
      which the Englishman now recognized in the distance. Thorndyke went into
      the bathing-room to watch those remaining in the great pool of
      rose-colored water. The sight was beautiful. The waves which lapped
      against the shelving shores of white marble were pink and white, and the
      deeper water was as red as coral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman was at once troubled over the fate of Johnston and elated
      over having won Bernardino's regard. Thoughtfully he strolled away from
      the bathers into a great picture-gallery. Here hung on the walls and stood
      on pedestals some of the rarest works of art he had ever seen. He passed
      through this room and was entering a shady retreat where plants, flowers
      and umbrageous trees grew thickly, when he heard a step behind him and the
      rustling of a silken skirt against the plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Bernardino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can be unobserved here,&rdquo; she said, taking off her thick veil and
      arranging her luxuriant hair. &ldquo;I hasten back. The king thinks, so my maid
      tells me, that I am asleep in my chamber. He is busy with an audience of
      police from a neighboring town and will not think of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on a sofa upholstered in leather, and he took a seat beside
      her. &ldquo;I am glad that we can talk alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I have much to ask
      you. First, tell me where we are,&mdash;where this strange country is on
      the map of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and it would greatly incense the king
      if he should find out that I had told you, for one of his chief pleasures
      is to note the surprise and admiration of new-comers over what they see
      here. But if you will promise to gratify his vanity in this particular I
      will try to explain it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise, and you can depend on my not getting you into trouble,&rdquo;
       replied Thorndyke. &ldquo;I never was so puzzled in my life, with that sullen
      sky overhead, the wonderful changing sunlight, and the remarkable
      atmosphere. I am both bewildered and entranced. Every moment I see
      something new and startling. Where are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far beneath the ocean and the surface of the earth. I only know what the
      king has let fall in my hearing in his conferences with his men of science
      and inventors; but I shall try to make you understand how it all came
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a long time ago, two hundred years back, I suppose, that one of my
      ancestors discovered a little isolated island in the Atlantic Ocean. He
      was forced in a storm to land there with his ship and crew to make some
      repairs in his vessel. In wandering about over the island he discovered a
      narrow entrance to a cave, and, with two or three of his men, he began to
      explore it. When they had gone for a mile or two down into the interior of
      the cavern, which seemed to lead straight down toward the centre of the
      earth, they began to find small pieces of gold. The further they went the
      more they found, till at last the very cavern walls seemed lined with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were at first wildly excited over their sudden good fortune and were
      about to load their ship with it and return to Europe at once, but the
      better judgment of my ancestor prevailed. He explained that, if the world
      were informed of the discovery of such an inexhaustible mine of gold, that
      the value of the precious metal would decline till it would be worth
      little more than some grosser metal, and that if they would only keep
      their secret to themselves they could in time control the finances of the
      world. So, acting on this suggestion, they only dug out a few thousand
      pounds and took part of it to Europe and part of it to America and turned
      it into money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, to curtail my story, they elected my ancestor as ruler, and, with
      ships loaded with every available convenience that inexhaustible wealth
      could procure and a colony of carefully chosen men, they returned to the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the men and their families had settled in the great roomy mouth of
      the cavern my ancestor supplied himself with several strong men and food
      and lights, and sought to explore the entire cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To their astonishment they found that it was practically endless. When
      they had gone down about sixty or seventy miles below the sea level they
      found themselves on a vast, undulating plain, the soil of which was dark
      and rich, with the black roof of the cavern arching overhead like the
      bottom of a great inverted bowl. And when they had travelled about ten
      days and reached the other side my ancestor calculated that the cave must
      be over one hundred miles in diameter and almost circular in shape. But
      what elated and surprised them most was the remarkable salubrity of the
      atmosphere. In all parts of the cave it was exactly the same temperature,
      and they found that they scarcely felt any fatigue from their journey, and
      that they had little desire to eat the provisions with which they were
      supplied. Indeed, the very air seemed permeated with a subtle quality that
      gave them strength and energy of mind and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, when, after a month had passed, and they returned to their
      anxious friends, these people overwhelmed them with exclamations of
      surprise over their appearance. And in the light of day the explorers
      looked at one another in astonishment, for, in the dim light of the
      lanterns they had carried, they had not noticed the great change that had
      come over them. They had all become the finest specimens of physical
      health that could be imagined. Their bodies had filled out; they were
      remarkably strong; their skins shone with healthful color and their eyes
      sparkled with intellectual energy, and their minds, even to the humblest
      burden-carrier, were astonishingly acute and active.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ancestor was a remarkable man, and he had hitherto shown much
      inventive ability; but in that month in the cave he had developed into an
      intellectual giant. After mature deliberation, he proposed a prodigious
      scheme to his followers. He explained that, while they might, by using the
      utmost discretion, hold the financial world in their power by means of
      their inexhaustible wealth, that the laws and restrictions of different
      countries prevented men of vast wealth from really enjoying more
      privileges than men of moderate means. He grew eloquent in speaking of the
      underground atmosphere, and proposed that they light the great cavern from
      end to end and make it an ideal place where they could live as it suited
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you guess the end. My ancestor was a great student of the
      sciences and had already thought of putting electricity to practical use.
      You are surprised? Yes, it has been applied to our purposes for two
      hundred years, while your people have understood its use such a short
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the Englishman. &ldquo;I see it all; the sun is an
      electric one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it runs mechanically over its great course as regularly as
      clock-work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More accurately, I assure you, but there probably never was a greater
      mathematical problem than they solved in deciding on the size the sun
      should be and amount of light necessary to fill up all the recesses of the
      great vacancy. It was all very crude at the start; for years a great
      electric light was simply suspended in the centre of the cavern's roof and
      the light did not vary in color. A son of the first king suggested the
      plan of giving the sun diurnal movement and the changing light. The moon
      and stars were a later development. They found, too, that the light could
      not be made to reach certain recesses in the cavern where the roof
      approached the earth, so they finally built a great wall to keep the
      inhabitants within proscribed boundaries, and to prevent them from
      understanding the machinery of the heavens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Thorndyke. &ldquo;But the temperature of the atmosphere,
      how does that happen to be so delightful and beneficial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they do not themselves thoroughly comprehend that. The heat
      comes from the internal fires, and the fresh air from without in some
      mysterious way. At first, in a few places, the heat was too severe, but
      the scientific men among the first settlers obviated this difficulty by
      closing up the hottest of the fissures and opening others in the cooler
      parts of the cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the people, where did they come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all parts of the earth. We had agents outside who selected such men
      and women that were willing to come, and who filled all the requirements,
      mentally and physically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do they desire to live here instead of out in the world, when
      they have all the wealth that they need to assure every advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They dread death, and it is undoubtedly true that life is prolonged here;
      our medical men declare that the longevity of every generation is
      improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible? But tell me about the sun, when it sets, what becomes of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes back to its place of rising through a great tunnel beneath us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke sat in deep thought for a moment; then he looked so steadily and
      so admiringly into Bernardino's eyes that she grew red with confusion.
      &ldquo;But you, yourself, are you thoroughly content here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing else,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I have heard little about your
      world except that your people are discontented, weak and insane, and that
      your changeable weather and your careless laws regarding marriage and
      heredity produce perpetual and innumerable diseases; that your people are
      not well developed and beautiful; that you war with one another, and that
      one tears down what another builds. I have, too, always been happy, and
      since you came I am happier still. I don't know what it means. I have
      never been so much interested in any one before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is love on the part of both of us,&rdquo; replied the Englishman
      impulsively, taking her hand. &ldquo;I never was content before. I went roving
      over the earth trying to end my life at sea or in balloon voyages, but now
      I only want to be with you. I have never dreamed that I could be so happy
      or that I would meet any one so beautiful as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernardino's delight showed itself in blushes on her face, and Thorndyke,
      unable to restrain himself, put his arm around her and drew her to his
      breast and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up quickly and he saw that she was trembling and that all the
      color had fled from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she did not answer, but only looked at him half-frightened, and
      then covered her face with her hands. He drew them from her face and
      compelled her to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he repeated, a strange fear at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken one of the most sacred laws of our country,&rdquo; she
      faltered, in great embarrassment; &ldquo;my father would punish me very severely
      if he knew of it, and he would banish you; for, to treat me in that
      manner, as his daughter, is regarded as an insult to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon most humbly,&rdquo; said the contrite Englishman. &ldquo;It was all
      on account of my ignorance of your customs and my impulsiveness. It shall
      never happen again, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face brightened a little and the color came back slowly. She sat down
      again, but not so near Thorndyke, and seemed desirous of changing the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you love the man my father has transported?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a good, faithful fellow, and it is hard to die so far away
      from friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to save him, but I cannot now think of a safe plan. The
      police are very vigilant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the darkness behind the sun&mdash;beyond the wall of which I spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of shame came into Thorndyke's face over the remembrance that he
      had made no effort to aid poor Johnston, and was sitting listening with
      delight to the conversation of Bernardino. He rose suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be doing something to aid him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot sit here
      inactive while he is in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient,&rdquo; she advised, looking at him admiringly; &ldquo;it is near night;
      see, it is the gray light of dusk; the sun is out of sight. To-night, if
      possible, I shall come to you. Perhaps I shall approach you without
      disguise if you are in the throne-room and my father does not object to my
      entertaining you, but for the present we must separate. Adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low as she turned away, and joined the throng that was passing
      along outside. An officer approached him. It was Captain Tradmos, who
      bowed and smiled pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; he said, with suave pleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon what?&rdquo; Thorndyke was on his guard at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon having pleased the king so thoroughly. No stranger, in my memory,
      has ever been treated so courteously. Every other new-comer is put under
      surveillance, but you are left unwatched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is easily pleased,&rdquo; said the Englishman, &ldquo;for I have done nothing to
      gratify him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he would like you; and I felt that your friend would have to
      suffer, but I could not help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall not suffer if I can prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh&mdash;be cautious. Those words, implying an inclination to treason, if
      spoken to any other officer would place you under immediate arrest. I like
      you, therefore I want to warn you against such folly. You are wholly in
      the king's power. Another thing I would specially warn you against&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to allow the king to suspect your admiration for the Princess
      Bernardino. It would displease the king. She is much taken with you; I saw
      it in her eyes when she danced for your entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke made no reply, but gazed searchingly into the eyes of the
      officer. Tradmos laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not, I trust you wholly; I know that you are honorable; I never
      make a mistake along that line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos bowed, pleased by the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall aid you all I can with my advice, for I know you will not betray
      me; but at present I am powerless to give you material aid. Every subject
      of this realm is bound to the autocratic will of the king. It is
      impossible for any one to get from under his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only outlet to the upper world is carefully guarded by men who would
      not be bribed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any chance for my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I can see, but I must walk on; there comes one of the king's
      attendants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has asked to speak to you,&rdquo; announced the attendant to
      Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; was his reply, and he followed the man through the
      crowded corridors into the throne-room of the king. Thorndyke forced a
      smile as he saw the king smiling at him as he approached the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my palace?&rdquo; asked the king, after Thorndyke had
      knelt before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is superb,&rdquo; answered the Englishman, recalling the advice of
      Bernardino. &ldquo;I am dazed by its splendor, its architecture, and its art. I
      have seen nothing to equal it on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king rose and stood beside him. His manner was both pleasing and
      sympathetic. &ldquo;I am persuaded,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you will make a good
      subject, and have the interest of Alpha always at heart, but I have often
      been mistaken in the character of men and think it best to give you a
      timely warning. An attendant will conduct you to a chamber beneath the
      palace where it will be your privilege to converse with a man who once
      planned to get up a rebellion among my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had come suddenly a stern harshness into the king's tone that roused
      the fears of Thorndyke. He was about to reply, but the king held up his
      hand. &ldquo;Wait till you have visited the dungeon of Nordeskyne, then I am
      sure that you will be convinced that strict obedience in thought as well
      as deed is best for an inhabitant of Alpha.&rdquo; Speaking thus, he signed to
      an attendant who came forward and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conduct him to the dungeon of Nordeskyne, and return to me,&rdquo; ordered the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's heart was heavy, and he was filled with strange forebodings,
      but he simply smiled and bowed, as the attendant led him away. The
      attendant opened a door at the back of the throne-room and they were
      confronted by darkness. They went along a narrow corridor for some
      distance, the darkness thickening at every step. There was no sound except
      the sound of the guide's shoes on the smooth stone pavement. Presently the
      man released Thorndyke's arm, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is narrow here, follow close behind, and do not attempt to go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly stick to you,&rdquo; replied the Englishman drily. They
      turned a sharp corner suddenly, and were going in another direction when
      Thorndyke felt a soft warm hand steal into his from behind, and knew
      intuitively that it was Bernardino. The guide was a few feet in advance of
      them and she drew Thorndyke's head down and whispered into his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brave&mdash;by all that you love&mdash;for your life, keep your
      presence of mind, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked the guide, turning suddenly and catching the
      Englishman's arm, &ldquo;I thought I heard whispering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying my prayers, that is all,&rdquo; and the Englishman pressed the
      hand of the princess, who, pressed close against the wall, was gliding
      cautiously away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prayers, humph&mdash;you'll need them later, come on!&rdquo; and he caught the
      Englishman's arm and hastily drew him onward. Thorndyke's spirits sank
      lower. The air of the narrow under-ground corridor was cold and damp, and
      he quivered from head to foot.

    <h2>
      Chapter IX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Branasko paused again in his walk towards the mysterious light.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be from the internal fires,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for this light is white,
      and the glow of the fires is red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's turn back,&rdquo; suggested Johnston, &ldquo;it can do us no good to go down
      there; it is only taking us further from the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to understand it,&rdquo; returned the Alphian thoughtfully; &ldquo;and,
      besides, there can be no more danger there than back among the hot
      crevices. We have got to perish anyway, and we might as well spice the
      remainder of our lives with whatever adventure we can. Who knows what we
      may not discover? There are many things about the land of Alpha that the
      inhabitants do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll follow you anywhere,&rdquo; acquiesced Johnston; &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stumbled on over the rocky surface in silence. At times, the roof of
      the cavern sank so low that they had to stoop to pass under it, and again
      it rose sharply like the roof of a cathedral, and the rays of the
      far-away, but ever-increasing light, shone upon glistening stalactites
      that hung from the darkness above them like daggers of diamonds set in
      ebony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so near as I supposed,&rdquo; said the Alphian wearily. &ldquo;And the
      light seemed to me to be shining on a cliff over which water is pouring in
      places. Yes, you can see that it is water by the ripples in the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but where can the light itself be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot yet tell; wait till we get nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour they came to a wide chasm on the other side of which
      towered a vast cliff of white crystal. It was on this that the trembling
      light was playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a waterfall after all,&rdquo; said Branasko; &ldquo;see, there is the source of
      the reflection,&rdquo; and he pointed to the left through a series of dark
      chambers of the cavern to a dazzling light. &ldquo;Come, let's go nearer it.&rdquo; He
      moved a few steps forward and then happening to look over his shoulder he
      stopped abruptly, and uttered an exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; And Johnston followed the eyes of the Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our shadows on the crystal cliff,&rdquo; said Branasko in an awed tone; &ldquo;only
      the light from the changing sun could make them so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shuddered superstitiously at the tone of Branasko's quivering
      voice, and their giant shadows which stood out on the smooth crystal like
      silhouettes. So clear-cut were they, that, in his own shadow, the American
      could see his breast heaving and in Branasko's the quivering of the
      Alphian's huge body and limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we have happened upon the home of the sun, only the spirit of the dead
      kings could tell what will become of us,&rdquo; said Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puh! you are blindly superstitious,&rdquo; said Johnston; &ldquo;what if we do come
      upon the sun? Let's go down there and look into the mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko fell into the rear and the American stoutly pushed ahead toward
      the light which was every moment increasing. As they advanced the cave got
      larger until it opened out into a larger plain over which hung fathomless
      darkness, and out of the plain a great dazzling globe of light was slowly
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sun itself,&rdquo; exclaimed Branasko, and he sank to the earth and
      covered his face with his hands. &ldquo;I have not thought ever to see it out of
      the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>

      The American was deeply thrilled by the grand sight. He sat down by
      Branasko and together they watched the vast ball of light emerge from the
      black earth and gradually disappear in a great hole in the roof of the
      cavern. It left a broad stream of light behind it, and, now that the sun
      itself was out of view, the silent spectators could see the great square
      hole from which it had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if by mutual consent, they rose and made their way over the rocks to
      the verge of the hole, which seemed several thousand feet square. At
      first, owing to the brightness of the sun overhead, they could see
      nothing; but, as the great orb gradually disappeared, they began to see
      lights and the figures of men moving about below. Later they observed the
      polished parts of stupendous machinery&mdash;machinery that moved almost
      noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston caught sight of a great net-work of moving cables reaching from
      the machinery up through the hole above and exclaimed enthusiastically:&mdash;&ldquo;A
      mechanical sun! electric daylight! What genius! A world in a great cave!
      Hundreds of square miles and thousands of well organized people living
      under the light of an artificial sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian looked at him astonished. &ldquo;Is it not so in your country?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston smiled. &ldquo;The great sun that lights the outer world is as much
      greater than that ball of light as Alpha is greater than a grain of sand.
      But this surely is the greatest achievement of man. But while I now
      understand how your sun goes over the whole of Alpha, I cannot see how it
      returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have not heard of the great tunnel of the Sun,&rdquo; replied the
      Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It runs beneath Alpha and connects the rising and setting points of the
      sun. There is a point beneath the king's palace where, by a staircase, the
      king and his officers may go down and inspect the sun as it is on its way
      back to the east during the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once a year a royal party goes in the sun over its entire course. It
      is said that it is sumptuously furnished inside, and not too warm, the
      lights being only innumerable small ones on the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were silent for a moment then Johnston said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we might be able to get into it unobserved and be thus carried
      over to the other side, or reach the palace through the tunnel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko started convulsively, and then, as he looked into the earnest
      eyes of the American, he said despondently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got to die, anyway; it may be well for us to think of it; but on
      the other side, in the Barrens, there is no more chance for escape than
      here. But the adventure would at least give us something to think about;
      let's try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; but how can we get down there where the sun starts to rise?&rdquo;
       asked the American, peering cautiously over the edge of the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some way,&rdquo; answered Branasko. &ldquo;Ah, see! further to the left
      there are some ledges; let's see what can be done that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rays of the departing sun were almost gone, and the electric lights
      down among the machinery seemed afar off like stars reflected in deep
      water. With great difficulty the two men lowered themselves from one sharp
      ledge to another till they had gone half down to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; said Branasko, peering over the lowest ledge. &ldquo;There are
      no more ledges and this one juts out so far that even if there were
      smaller ones beneath we could not get to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed the American, &ldquo;but look, is not that a lake
      beneath? I think it must be, for the lights are reflected on its surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; answered Branasko; &ldquo;and I now see a chance for us to get
      down safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The workers are too far from the lake to see us; we can drop into the
      water and swim ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would they not hear the splashing of our bodies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not; but first let's experiment with a big stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suiting the action to the word, they secured a stone weighing about
      seventy-five pounds and brought it to the ledge. Carefully poising it in
      mid-air, they let it go. Down it went, cutting the air with a sharp
      whizzing sound. They listened breathlessly, but heard no sound as the rock
      struck the water, and the men among the machinery seemed undisturbed. Only
      the widening circles of rings on the lake's surface indicated where the
      stone had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; ejaculated the Alphian; &ldquo;are you equal to such a plunge? The water
      must be deep, and we won't be hurt at all if only we can keep our feet
      downward and hold our breath long enough. Our clothing will soon dry down
      there, for feel the warmth that comes from below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian slowly crawled out on the sharpest projection of the ledge.
      &ldquo;Are you willing to try it?&rdquo; he asked, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait till you see me swim ashore, and then follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shuddered as the strong fellow swung himself over the ledge and
      hung downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; said Branasko, and he let go. Down he fell, as straight as an
      arrow, into the shadows below. For an instant Johnston heard the
      fluttering of the fellow's clothing as he fell through the darkness, and
      then there was no sound except the low whirr of the cables and the
      monotonous hum of the great wheels beneath. Then the smooth surface of the
      lake was broken in a white foaming spot, and, later, he saw something
      small and dark slowly swimming shoreward. It was Branasko, and the men to
      the right had not heard or seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston saw him reach the shore, then he crawled out to the point of the
      projecting rock and tremblingly lowered himself till he hung downward as
      Branasko had done. He had just drawn a deep breath preparatory to letting
      go his hold, when, chancing to look down, he saw a long narrow barge
      slowly emerging from the cliff directly under him. For an instant he was
      so much startled that he almost lost his grip on the rock. He tried to
      climb back on the ledge, but his strength was gone. He felt that he could
      not hold out till the boat had passed. Death was before him, and a
      horrible one. The boat seemed to crawl. Everything was a blur before his
      eyes. His fingers began to relax, and with a low cry he fell.

    <h2>
      Chapter X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Thorndyke the dark corridor seemed endless. The king's last words had
      now a sinister meaning, and Bernardino's whispered warning filled him with
      dread. &ldquo;Keep your presence of mind,&rdquo; she urged; was it then, some
      frightful mental ordeal he was about to pass through?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came to a door. Thorndyke heard his guide feeling for the
      bolt and key-hole. The rattling of the keys sounded like a ghostly threat
      in the empty corridors. The air was as damp as a fog, and the stones were
      cold and slimy. After a moment the guard succeeded in unlocking the door
      and roughly pushed the Englishman forward. The door closed with a little
      puff, and Thorndyke felt about him for the guide; but he was alone. For a
      moment there was no sound. With the closing of the door it seemed to him
      that he was cut off from every living creature. In the awful silence he
      could hear his own heart beating like a drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; came in a hissing whisper from the darkness near
      by, and then the invisible whisperer moved away, making a weird sound as
      he slid his hand along a wall, till it died away in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold thrill ran over him. He was a brave man and feared no living man or
      beast, but the superstitious fears of his childhood now came upon him with
      redoubled force. For several minutes he did not stir; presently he put out
      his hand to the door and his blood ran cold. There was no knob, latch, or
      key-hole, and he could feel the soft padding into which the door closed to
      keep out sound. Then he remembered the warning of the princess, and strove
      with all his might to fight down his apprehensions. &ldquo;For your life keep
      your presence of mind,&rdquo; he repeated over and over, but try as he would his
      terror over-powered him. He laughed out loud, but in the dreadful silence
      and darkness his laugh sounded unearthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold perspiration broke out on him. It seemed as if hours passed before
      he again heard the sliding noise on the wall. Some one was coming to him.
      The sound grew louder and nearer, till a firm hand was laid on his arm; it
      felt as cold as ice through his clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; a voice whispered, and the Englishman was led forward. Presently
      another door opened&mdash;a door that closed after them without any sound.
      Here the silence was more intensified, the darkness thicker as if
      compressed like air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hands were placed on the shoulders of Thorndyke and he was gently forced
      into a chair. As soon as he was seated two metal clamps grasped like a
      vise his arms between the elbows and the shoulders, and two more fastened
      round his ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint puff of air from the door and the prisoner felt that he
      was alone. Terror held him in bondage. He tried to think of Bernardino,
      but in vain. Did they intend to drive him to madness? He began to suspect
      that the king had discovered his natural superstition and had decided to
      put it to a test. What he had undergone so far he felt was but the
      introduction to greater terrors in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sigh far away in the darkness&mdash;then a groan that seemed
      to flit about in space, as if seeking to escape the dark, and then died
      away in a low moan of despair. Before him the blackness seemed to hang
      like a dark curtain about ten yards in front of him, and in it shone a
      tiny speck of light no larger than the head of a pin, and which was so
      bright that he could not look at it steadily. It increased to the size of
      a pea, and then he discovered that, at times, it would seem miles away in
      space and then again to draw quite near to hand. Glancing down, he noticed
      that it cast a bright round spot about an inch in diameter on the floor,
      and that the spot was slowly revolving in a circle so small that its
      motion was hardly observable. Surely the mind of a superstitious man was
      never so punished! When Thorndyke looked steadily at the spot, the black
      floor seemed to recede, and the spot to sink far down into the empty
      darkness below like a solitary star; So realistic was this that the
      Englishman could not keep from fancying that this chair was poised in some
      way over fathomless space. Presently he noticed that the spot had ceased
      its circular movement and was slowly&mdash;almost as slowly as the
      movement of the hand of a clock&mdash;advancing in a straight line toward
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such terror had ever before possessed the stout heart of the
      Englishman. As the uncanny spot, ever growing brighter, advanced toward
      him, he thought his heart had stopped beating; his brain was in a whirl.
      After a long while the spot reached his feet and began to climb up his
      legs. With a shudder and a smothered cry, he tried to draw his feet away,
      but they were too firmly manacled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is searching for my heart,&rdquo; thought Thorndyke. &ldquo;My God, when it
      reaches it, I shall die!&rdquo; As the strange spot, gleaming like a burning
      diamond in whose heart leaped a thousand different colored flames, and
      which seemed possessed of some strange hellish purpose, crossed his thighs
      and began to climb up his body, the brain of the prisoner seemed on fire.
      He tried to close his eyes, but, horror of horrors! his eyelids were
      paralyzed. It was almost over his heart, and Thorndyke was fainting
      through sheer mental exhaustion when it stopped, began to descend slowly,
      and, then, with a rapid, wavering motion, it fell to the floor, flashed
      about in the darkness, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour dragged slowly by. What would happen next? The Englishman felt
      that his frightful ordeal was not over. To his surprise the darkness began
      to lighten till he could see dimly the outlines of the chamber. It was
      bare save for the chair he occupied against a wall, and a couch on the
      opposite side of the room. The couch held something which looked like a
      human body covered with a white cloth. He could see where the sheet
      rounded over the head and rose sharply at the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something told him that it was a corpse and a new terror possessed him.
      For several minutes he gazed at the couch in dreadful suspense, then his
      heart stopped pulsing as the figure on the couch began to move. Slowly the
      sheet fell from the head and the figure sat up stiffly. There was a faint
      hum of hidden machinery at the couch, and a flashing blue and green line
      running from the couch to the wall betrayed the presence of an electric
      wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the figure rose, and with creaking, rattling joints stood erect.
      Pale lights shone in the orbits of the eyes and the sound of harsh
      automatic breathing came from the mouth and nostrils. Slowly and haltingly
      the figure advanced toward Thorndyke. The poor fellow tried to wrench
      himself free from the chair, but he could not stir an inch. On came the
      figure, its long arms swinging mechanically, and its feet slurring over
      the stone pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      When within ten feet of the Englishman it stopped, nodded its head three
      or four times, and slowly opened its mouth. There was a sharp, whirring
      noise, such as comes from a phonograph, and a voice spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My voice shall sound on earth for a million years after my spirit has
      left my body; and I shall wander about my dark dungeon as a warning to men
      not to do as I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice ceased, but the whirring sound in the creature's breast went on.
      The figure shambled nearer to Thorndyke and the voice began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disobeyed the laws of great Alpha and her imperial king and am to die.
      Beware of the temptation to search into the royal motives or attempt to
      escape. The fate of all the inhabitants of Alpha, the wonderful Land of
      the Changing Sun, is in the hands of its ruler. Beware! My death-torture
      is to be lingering and horrible. I sink into deepest dejection. I was
      eager to return to my native land and tried to escape. Behold my
      punishment! Even my bones and flesh will not be allowed to rest or decay.
      Beware, the king is just and good, but he will be obeyed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the figure retreated toward the couch and lay down on it. The
      whirring sound ceased, the light along the wire went out, and the darkness
      thickened till the couch and the outlines of the chamber were obscured.
      Then Thorndyke's chair was lifted, as if by unseen hands, and he was borne
      backward. In a moment he felt the cool, damp air of the corridor, and some
      one raised him to his feet and led him back to the throne-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bright light which burst on him as the door opened, the beautiful
      women and handsome men moving about the throne were to him like a glimpse
      of Paradise. The attendant left him at the door and he walked in, so dazed
      and weak that he hardly knew what to do. No one seemed to notice him and
      the king was engaged in an animated conversation with several ladies who
      were sitting at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a bevy of women Thorndyke noticed Bernardino. She gave him a quick,
      sympathetic glance of recognition and then looked down discreetly.
      Presently she left the others and moved on till she had disappeared behind
      a great carved wine-cistern which stood on the backs of four crouching
      golden leopards in a retired part of the room. Something in her sudden
      movement made the Englishman think she wanted to speak to him, and he went
      to her. He was not mistaken, for she smiled as he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she whispered, touching his arm impulsively, and then quickly
      removing her hand as if afraid of detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of what?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad that you stood that&mdash;that torture so well; several men have
      died in that chair and some went mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered your advice; that saved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a plan for us to try to rescue your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I had forgotten him! what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Tradmos likes you and has consented to aid us. We shall need an
      air-ship and he has one at his disposal which is used only for
      governmental purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with the air-ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go beyond and over the great wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can we get away from here without being seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under ordinary circumstances, neither by day nor night, but tomorrow the
      king has planned to let his people witness a 'War of the Elements.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A War of the Elements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the grandest fete of Alpha. There will be a frightful storm in the
      sky; no light for hours; the thunder will be musical and the lightning
      will seem to set the world on fire. That will be our chance. When it is
      darkest we shall try to get away unseen. We may fail. Such a daring thing
      has never been attempted by any one. If we are detected we shall suffer
      death as the penalty, the king could never pardon such a bold violation of
      law.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnston clung tenaciously to the rock. He tried to look down to see if
      the barge had passed beneath him, but the intense strain on his arm now
      drew his head back, so that he could not do so. Once more he made an
      effort to regain his position on the rock, but he was not able to raise
      himself an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt certain that the fall would kill him, and he groaned in agony. His
      fingers were benumbed and beginning to slip. Then he fell. The air whizzed
      in his ears. He tried to keep his feet downward, but it was no use. He was
      whirled heels over head many times, and his senses were leaving him when
      he was restored by a plunge into the cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down he sank. It seemed to him that he never would lose his momentum and
      that he would strangle before he could rise to the surface. Finally,
      however, he came up more dead than alive. He had narrowly missed the
      flat-boat, for he saw it receding from him only a few yards away. On the
      shore stood Branasko motioning to him; and, slowly, for his strength was
      almost gone, Johnston swam toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter waded out into the shallow water and drew him ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a narrow escape,&rdquo; he said, with a dry laugh. &ldquo;I saw the boat come
      from under the cliff just as you hung down from the ledge. At first I
      hoped that you would get back on the rock, but when I saw you try and do
      it and fail I thought that you were lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American could not speak for exhaustion; but, as he looked at the
      departing craft with concern, Branasko laughed again: &ldquo;Oh, you thought it
      had a crew; so did I at first, but it has no one aboard. It is drawn by a
      cable, and seems to be laden with coal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they notice our fall up there?&rdquo; panted Johnston, nodding toward the
      lights in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are farther away than I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what ought we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hide here among the rocks till our clothing
      dries and then look about us. We have nearly twenty-four hours to wait for
      the sun to return through the tunnel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the tunnel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over on the other side of that black hill. There, you can see the mouth
      of the tunnel through which the sun comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need sleep,&rdquo; said the Alphian, when their clothing was dry, &ldquo;and it
      may be a long time before we get a chance to get it. Let us lie down in
      the shadow of that rock and rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston consented, and, lying down together, they soon dropped asleep.
      They slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was the first to awake. He felt so refreshed that he knew he must
      have been unconscious several hours. He touched Branasko and the latter
      sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked about him bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a horrible dream,&rdquo; he said shuddering. &ldquo;I thought that we were in
      the sun and over the capital city when it fell down. I thought the fall
      was awful, and that all Alpha was aflame. Then the fires went out.
      Everything was black, and the whole world rang with cries of terrified
      people. Ugh! I don't want to dream so again; I'd rather not sleep at all.
      But hush! what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far away, as if in the centre of the earth, they heard a low monotonous
      rumbling. They listened breathlessly. Every moment the sound increased.
      They could feel the ground trembling as if shaken by an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the coming sun,&rdquo; said Branasko. &ldquo;We must get nearer the tunnel and
      see what can be done. It would be useless to try to go back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stealing along in the shadow of the cliffs to keep from being seen by the
      workmen on the plateau above, they climbed over a rocky incline and saw in
      the side of a towering cliff, a great black hole. It was the mouth of the
      tunnel. Into it ran eight wide tracks of railway and six mammoth cables
      each twenty or thirty feet in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun cannot be far away now,&rdquo; remarked the Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not lighted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume not; I think it comes through in darkness. The light is saved
      for its passage over Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be as safe for us to attempt to walk through the tunnel to
      the palace of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never; it would be over fifty miles in utter darkness. There may be a
      thousand trestles and bridges over frightful chasms: for the most part, I
      have heard the tunnel is a natural channel or a succession of caverns
      united by tunnels. The other is the safer way, though it certainly is
      risky enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louder and nearer grew the rumbling noise, and a faint light began to
      shine from the tunnel and flash on the cliff opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sun's headlight,&rdquo; explained Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was thrilled to the centre of his being as he saw the light
      playing over the polished tracks and cables and illuminating the walls of
      the great tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a deep, mellow-toned stroke of a bell in the sun, and,
      as the two men shrank involuntarily into the deeper shade of the cliff,
      the great globe, a stupendous ball of crystal, five hundred feet in
      height, slowly emerged from the mouth of the tunnel and came to a stop
      under the opening in the rock which led to the space above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had we better do now?&rdquo; said Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; cautioned Branasko, and he drew the American to a great boulder
      nearer the sun, from behind which they could, without being seen, watch
      the action of the crowd of workmen that was hurriedly approaching. They
      placed ladders of steel against the sides of the sun and swarmed over it
      like bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are cleaning the glass and adjusting the lights,&rdquo; said the Alphian;
      &ldquo;wait till they go round to the other side. Don't you see that square
      opening near the ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the door,&rdquo; said Branasko, &ldquo;and we must try to enter it while they
      are on the other side. Let us slip nearer; there is another rock ahead
      that we can hide behind.&rdquo; Suiting the action to the word, Branasko led the
      way, stooping near to the ground until both were safely ensconced behind
      the boulder in question. They were now so near that they could hear the
      electricians rubbing the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who seemed to be superintending the work opened the door and went into
      the sun and lighted a bright light. From where they were crouched Johnston
      and Branasko caught a view of a little hall, a flight of stairs, and some
      pictures on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the man extinguished the light and came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are removing their ladders from this side,&rdquo; said Branasko in a
      whisper. &ldquo;Be ready; we must act quickly and without a particle of sound.
      Run straight for that door and climb up the steps immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men had all gone round to the other side, and no one was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! Follow me,&rdquo; and bending low to the earth the Alphian darted across
      the intervening space and into the doorway. Johnston was quite as
      successful. As he entered the door he saw Branasko crawling up the
      carpeted stairs ahead of him, and, on his all-fours, he followed. The
      first landing was large, and there in the wall they found a closet. It
      would have been dark but for a dim light that streamed down from above.
      Branasko opened the closet door. &ldquo;We must hide here for the present,&rdquo; he
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had barely got seated on the floor and closed the door when a bright
      light broke round them and they heard somebody ascending the stairs. The
      person passed by and went on further up. The two adventurers dared not
      exchange a word. They could hear the footsteps above and the sound of the
      electricians outside as they polished the lights and moved their ladders
      from place to place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he should stay, what could we do?&rdquo; asked Johnston, after a long pause,
      and when the footsteps sounded farther away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two of us and one of him,&rdquo; grimly replied the brawny Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston shuddered. &ldquo;Let's not commit murder in any emergency,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be murder; every man has a right to save his own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said just then, for the footsteps were growing nearer.
      The man was descending. He crossed the landing they were on and went down
      the last flight of stairs and out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Branasko rubbed his rough hands together. &ldquo;We are going alone,&rdquo; he said
      with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of sliding ladders on the walls outside. The workmen had
      finished their task. A moment later a great bell overhead rang mellowly;
      the colossal sphere trembled and rocked and then rose and swung easily
      forward like the car of a balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are rising,&rdquo; said the Alphian, in a tone of superstitious awe.
      Johnston said nothing. There was a cool, sinking sensation in his stomach
      and his head was swimming. Branasko, however, was in possession of all his
      faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon be through the shaft we first discovered and throw our
      light over Alpha.&rdquo; As he spoke the space about them broke into blinding
      brightness and for a few moments they could only open their eyes for an
      instant at a time. After a while Branasko opened the closet door and they
      went up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first apartment they entered was most luxuriously furnished. Sofas,
      couches and reclining-chairs were scattered here and there over the
      elegant carpet, and statues of gold and marble stood in alcoves and niches
      and strange stereopticon lanterns, hanging from the ceiling threw
      ever-changing and life-like pictures on the walls. The light streamed in
      from without through small circular windows. After they had walked about
      the room for some minutes, the Alphian pointed to a half-open door and a
      staircase at one side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it leads to some sort of observatory on top,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
      heard that when the royal family makes this voyage they are fond of
      looking out from it. Suppose we see.&rdquo; Johnston acquiesced, and Branasko
      opened the door. From the increased brightness that came in they were
      assured that the stairs led outward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending many flights of stairs and traversing a narrow winding gallery
      which seemed to be gradually sloping upward, they finally reached the
      outside, and found themselves on a platform about forty feet square
      surrounded by iron balustrades. Above hung impenetrable blackness, below
      curved a majestic sphere of white light.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sunlight was fading into gray when the princess turned to leave
      Thorndyke. Night was drawing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they assigned you a chamber yet?&rdquo; she paused to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they have overlooked it; I shall remind the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her beautiful, lithe form was clearly outlined against the red glow of the
      massive swinging lamp as she moved gracefully away, and Thorndyke's heart
      bounded with admiration and hope as he thought of her growing regard for
      him. He resumed his seat among the flowers, listening, as if in a
      delightful dream, to the seductive music from bands in different parts of
      the palace and the never-ceasing sound in the air which seemed to him to
      be the concentrated echo of all the sounds in the strange country
      rebounding from the vast cavern roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew darker. The gray outside had changed to purple. In the palace the
      brilliant electric lights in prismatic globes refused to allow the day to
      die. He was thinking of returning to the throne-room when a page in silken
      attire approached from the direction of the king's quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your chambers, master,&rdquo; he announced, bowing respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke arose and followed him to an elevator near by. They ascended to
      the highest balcony of the great rotunda. Here they alighted and turned to
      the right, the page leading the way, a key in his hand. Presently the page
      stopped at a door and unlocked it and preceded the Englishman into the
      room. As they entered an electric light in a chandelier flashed up
      automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sumptuous apartment, and adjoining it were several connecting
      rooms all elegantly furnished. The page crossed the room and opened a door
      to a little stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads to the roof,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The princess told me to call your
      attention to it, that you might go out and view the starlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the page had retired, Thorndyke, feeling lonely, ascended the stairs
      to the roof. It was perfectly flat save for the great dome which stood in
      the centre and the numerous pinnacles and cupolas on every hand, and was
      very spacious. The Englishman's loneliness increased, for no matter in
      what direction he looked, there was not a living soul in sight. Far in
      front of him he saw a stone parapet. He went to this and looked down on
      the city. The electric lights were vari-colored, and arranged so that when
      seen from a distance or from a great height they assumed artistic designs
      that were beautiful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regular streets and rows of buildings stretched away till the light in
      the farthest distance seemed an ocean of blending colors. Overhead the
      vault was black, and only here and there shone a star; but as he looked
      upward they began to flash into being, and so rapidly that the sky seemed
      a vast battlefield of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo; he ejaculated enthusiastically, when the black
      dome was filled with twinkling stars. He leaned for a long time against
      the parapet, listening to the music from the streets below, and watching
      the flying-machines with their vari-colored lights rise from the little
      parks at the intersection of the streets and dart away over the roofs like
      big fireflies. Then he began to feel sleepy, and, going back to his
      chambers, he retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke the next morning, the rosy glow of the sun was shining in at
      his windows. On rising he was surprised to find a delectable breakfast
      spread on a table in his sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treating me like a lord, any way,&rdquo; he said drily. &ldquo;I can't say I dislike
      the thing as a whole.&rdquo; When he had satisfied his sharp hunger he went out
      into a corridor and seeing an elevator he entered it and went down to the
      throne-room. The king was just leaving his throne, but seeing Thorndyke he
      turned to him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you sleep?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, indeed,&rdquo; replied Thorndyke, with a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot talk to you now. I intended to, but I have promised my people a
      'War of the Elements' to-day and am busy. You will enjoy it, I trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be about the palace, for it is a good point from which to view the
      display.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he turned away and the Englishman, as if drawn there by
      the memory of his last conversation with Bernardino, sought the retreat
      where he had bidden her good-night. He sat down on the seat they had
      occupied, and gave himself over to delightful reveries about her beauty
      and loveliness of nature. Looking up suddenly he saw a pair of white hands
      part the palm leaves in front of him and the subject of his thoughts
      emerged into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a regal gown and beautiful silken head-dress set with fine gems,
      and gave him a warm glance of friendly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I half hoped to find you here,&rdquo; she said, blushing modestly under his
      ardent gaze; &ldquo;that is, I knew you would not know where to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused, her face suffused with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hope to find you here,&rdquo; he said, coming to her aid gallantly,
      &ldquo;but it was a delight to sit here where I last saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed even deeper, and a pleased look flashed into her eyes. &ldquo;It was
      important that I should see you this morning,&rdquo; she continued, with a
      womanly desire to disguise her own feeling. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you where to
      meet me when the storm begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the roof of the palace, near the stairs leading down to your chambers.
      At first it will be very dark, and it is then that we must get out of
      sight of the palace. No other flying-machines will be in the air, and
      Captain Tradmos thinks, if we are very careful, we can get away safely
      before the display of lightning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we find my friend what can we do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment, a look of perplexity on her face, then she said:
      &ldquo;We can bring him back and keep him hidden in your chambers till some
      better arrangement can be made. We shall think of some expedient before
      long, but at present he must be saved from starvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke attempted to draw her to a seat beside him, but she held back.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said resolutely, &ldquo;it would never do for us to be seen together.
      If my father should suspect anything now, all hope would be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke reluctantly released her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said humbly. &ldquo;I shall meet you
      promptly. Of course I want to save poor Johnston, but the delight of being
      with you again, even for a moment, so intoxicates me that I forget even my
      duty to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After she left him he wandered out in the streets along the busy
      thoroughfares, and into the beautiful parks, the flowers and foliage
      changing color as each new hour dawned. The fragrance of the flowers
      delighted his sense of smell, and the luscious fruits hung from vine and
      tree in great abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was impatient for the time to arrive at which he was to meet the
      princess. After awhile he noticed the people closing the shops and booths,
      and in holiday dress going to the parks and public squares. He hastened to
      the palace. The great rotunda and the throne-room were energetically
      astir. Everybody wore rich apparel and was talking of the coming fete. The
      king was on his throne surrounded by his men of science. In a cluster of
      ladies in court dress, the Englishman recognized Bernardino. Catching his
      eye, she looked startled for an instant, and, then, with a furtive glance
      at the king, she swept her eyes back to Thorndyke and raised them
      significantly toward his chambers. He understood, and his quick movement
      was his reply. He turned immediately to an elevator that was going up, and
      entered it. Again he was alone on the palace roof. The color of the
      sunlight looked so natural that he studied it closely to see if he could
      not detect something artificial in its appearance, but in vain. He found
      that it did not pain his eyes to look at the sun steadily. He took from
      his pocket a small sunglass, and focussed the rays on his hand, but the
      heat was not intensified sufficiently to burn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then he heard a loud blast of a trumpet in a tall tower to the left
      of the palace. It seemed a momentous signal. The jostling crowds in the
      streets below suddenly stood motionless. Every eye was raised to the sky.
      Not a sound broke the stillness. Following the glances of the crowd a few
      minutes later, Thorndyke noticed a dark cloud rising in the west, and
      spreading along the horizon. A feeling of awe came over him as it
      gradually increased in volume, and, in vast black billows, began to roll
      up toward the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly out of the stillness came a faraway rumble like a fusillade of
      cannon, now dying down low, again reaching such a height that it pained
      the ears. Belated flying-machines darted across the sky here and there,
      like storm-frightened birds, but they soon settled to earth. Every eye was
      on the cloud which was now gashed with dazzling, vivid, electric flashes.
      Thorndyke looked over the vast roof. He was alone. He walked to the
      western parapet to get a broader view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds had increased till almost a third of the heavens were obscured
      by the madly whirling blackness. There was a rumble in the cloud, or
      beyond it, like thunder, and yet it was not, unless thunder can be
      attuned, for the sound was like the music of a great orchestra magnified a
      thousand-fold. The grand harmony died down. There was a blinding flash of
      electricity in the clouds, and the Englishman involuntarily covered his
      eyes with his hands. When he looked again the blackness was covering the
      sun. For a moment its disk showed blood-red through the fringe of the
      cloud and then disappeared. Total darkness fell on everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was profound. The very air seemed stagnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wind overhead, by some unseen force, was lashed into fury, and
      all the sky was filled with whirlpools of deeper blackness. Suddenly there
      was a flash of soft golden light; this was followed by streams of pink, of
      blue and of purple till the whole heavens were hung with banners, flags,
      and rain-bows of flame. Again darkness fell, and it seemed all the deeper
      after the gorgeous scene which had preceded it. Thorndyke strained his
      sight to detect something moving below, but nothing could be seen, and no
      sound came up from the motionless crowds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him he heard a soft footstep on the stone tiling. It drew nearer. A
      hand was being carefully slid along the parapet. The hand reached him and
      touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the princess. &ldquo;Ah, I have at last found you,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I saw
      you in the lightning, but lost you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her and drew her into his embrace. He tried to speak,
      but uttered only an inarticulate sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not possibly come earlier,&rdquo; she apologized, nestling against him
      so closely that he could feel the quick and excited beating of her heart.
      &ldquo;My father kept me with him till only a moment ago. Captain Tradmos will
      be here soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the trouble,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We had counted on getting away in the
      darkness, before the display of lightning, but there is more danger now.
      If our flying-machine were noticed the search-lights would be turned on us
      and we would be discovered at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if we get safely away in the darkness when could we return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be easy,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;As soon as the fete is over,
      commerce will be resumed and the air will be filled with air-ships that
      have been delayed in their regular business, and, in the disguises which I
      have for us both, we could come back without rousing suspicion. We could
      alight in Winter Park and return home later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Winter Park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen it? You must do so; it is one of the wonders of Alpha.
      It is a vast park enclosed with high walls and covered with a roof of
      glass. Inside the snow falls, and we have sleighing and coasting and lakes
      of ice for skating. It was an invention of the king. The snowstorms there
      are beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke's reply was drowned in a harmonious explosion like that of tuned
      cannon; this was followed by the chimes of great bells which seemed to
      swing back and forth miles overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; whispered Bernardino, &ldquo;father calls it 'musical thunder,' and he
      declares that it is produced in no other country but this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not; he is right.&rdquo; And the heart of the Englishman was stirred by
      deep emotion. He had never dreamed that anything could so completely chain
      his fancy and elevate his imagination as what he heard. The musical
      clangor died down. The strange harmony grew more entrancing as it
      softened. Then the whole eastern sky began to flush with rosy, shimmering
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father calls this the 'Ideal Dawn of Day,'&rdquo; whispered Bernardino. &ldquo;See
      the faint golden halo near the horizon; that is where the sun is supposed
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it done?&rdquo; asked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few of our people know. It is a secret held only by the king and half a
      dozen scientists. The whole thing, however, is operated by two men in a
      room in the dome of the palace. The musician is a young German who was
      becoming the wonder of the musical world when father induced him to come
      to us. I have met him. He says he has been thoroughly happy here. He lives
      on music. He showed me the instrument he used to play, a little thing he
      called a violin, and its tones could not reach beyond the limits of a
      small room. He laughs at it now and says the instrument that father gave
      him to play on has strings drawn from the centre of the earth to the stars
      of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rose-light had spread over the horizon and climbed almost to the
      zenith, and with the dying booming and gentle clangor it began to fade
      till all was dark again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Tradmos ought to be here now,&rdquo; continued the princess, glancing
      uneasily toward the stairway. &ldquo;We may not have so good an opportunity as
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, something has gone wrong,&rdquo; whispered Bernardino. &ldquo;I have never
      seen the darkness last so long as this; besides, can't you hear the
      muttering of the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke acknowledged that he did. He was about to add something else,
      but was prevented by a loud blast from the trumpet in the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernardino shrank from him and fell to trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The trumpet!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;something
      awful has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment of profound silence, then the murmuring of the crowd rose
      sullenly like the moaning of a rising storm; a search-light flashed up in
      the gloom and swept its uncertain stream from point to point, but it died
      out. Another and another shone for an instant in different parts of the
      city, but they all failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something awful has happened,&rdquo; repeated Bernardino, as if to herself;
      &ldquo;the lights will not burn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we not better go down?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke anxiously, excited by her
      unusual perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer she mutely drew him to the eastern parapet. Far away in the
      east there still lingered a faint hint of pink, but all over the whole
      landscape darkness rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she exclaimed, pointing upward, &ldquo;the clouds are thinning over the
      sun, and yet there is no light. What can be the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture they heard soft steps on the roof and a voice calling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernardino! Princess Bernardino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Tradmos,&rdquo; she ejaculated gladly, then she called out softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tradmos! Tradmos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; the voice said, and a figure loomed up before them. It was the
      captain. He was panting violently, as if he had been running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, clasping his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun has gone out,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      A groan escaped her lips and she swayed into Thorndyke's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clouds are thinning over the sun, yet there is no light. The king is
      excited; he fears a panic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has such a thing never happened?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hundred years ago; then thousands lost their lives. As soon as the
      people suspect the cause of the delay they will go mad with fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; asked the princess, recovering her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, wait!&rdquo; replied Tradmos. &ldquo;This is as safe a place as you could
      find. Perhaps the trouble may be averted. Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disk of the veiled sun was aglow with a faintly trembling light; but
      it went out. The silence was profound. The populace seemed unable to grasp
      the situation, but when the light had flickered over the black face of the
      sun once more and again expired, a sullen murmur rose and grew as it
      passed from lip to lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became a threatening roar, broken by an occasional cry of pain and a
      dismal groan of terror. There was a crash as if a mountain had been burst
      by explosives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The swinging bridge has been thrown down!&rdquo; said Tradmos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light after light flashed up in different parts of the city, but they were
      so small and so far apart that they seemed to add to the darkness rather
      than to lessen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon, it will rise!&rdquo; cried the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot,&rdquo; said Tradmos in his beard, &ldquo;at least not for several hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will kill my father,&rdquo; she said despondently, &ldquo;they always hold him
      responsible for any accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot reach him,&rdquo; consoled Tradmos. &ldquo;He is safe for the present at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible to make the repairs needed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. When the accident happened long ago the sun was just
      rising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it stopped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not; it has simply gone out; the electric connection has, in some
      way, been cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tumult seemed to have extended to the very limits of the city, and was
      constantly increasing. The smashing of timber and the falling of heavy
      stones were heard near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradmos leaned far over the parapet. &ldquo;They are coming toward us!&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;they intend to destroy the palace; we must try to get down, but we shall
      meet danger even there.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnston and Branasko looked down at the great ball of light below them in
      silent wonder. Johnston was the first to speak. He pointed to the four
      massive cables which supported the sun at each corner of the platform and
      extended upward till they were enveloped in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hold us up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where do they go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the big trucks which run on the tracks near the roof of the cavern;
      the endless cables are up there, too, but we can not see them with this
      glare about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can see nothing of Alpha from here,&rdquo; remarked Johnston disappointedly,
      &ldquo;we can see nothing beyond our circle of light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to look down from this height at night,&rdquo; said the Alphian.
      &ldquo;It would be a great view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Johnston went to one side of the platform and laid his
      hand on the spokes of a polished metal wheel shaped like the pilot-wheel
      of a steamboat. Branasko hastened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch it,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;It looks as if it were to turn the electric
      connection off and on. If the sun should go out, the consequences would be
      awful. The people of Alpha would go mad with fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American withdrew his hand, and he and Branasko walked back to the
      centre of the platform. Johnston uttered an exclamation of surprise. &ldquo;The
      light is changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was, for it was gradually fading into a purple that was
      delightfully soothing to the eye after the painful brightness of a moment
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the Alphian, &ldquo;we are running very slow and are only
      now about to approach the great wall, for purple is the color of the first
      morning hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is the light changed?&rdquo; asked Johnston curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By some shifting of glasses through which the rays shine, I presume,&rdquo;
       returned the Alphian; &ldquo;but the mechanism seems to be concealed in the
      walls of the globe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word was spoken for an hour. They had lain down on the platform near
      the iron railing which encompassed it, and Branasko was dozing
      intermittently. Again the light began to change gradually. This time it
      was gray. Johnston put out his hand to touch Branasko, but the Alphian was
      awake. He sat up and nodded smiling. &ldquo;Wait till the next hour,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;it will be rose-color; that is the most beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the hours dragged by till the yellow light showed that it was the
      sixth hour. Branasko had been exploring the vast interior below and came
      back to Johnston who was asleep on the floor of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just thought of something,&rdquo; said Branasko. &ldquo;This is the day
      appointed by the king to entertain his subjects with a grand display of
      the elements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; explained the Alphian, &ldquo;darkens the sun with clouds so that
      all Alpha is blacker than night, and then he produces great storms in the
      sky, and lightning and musical thunder. We may, perhaps, hear the music,
      but we cannot witness the storm and electric display on account of the
      light about us. It usually begins at this hour; so be silent and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes there was a rumble from below like the roar of a
      volcano and an answering echo from the black dome overhead. This died away
      and was succeeded by a crash of musical thunder that thrilled Johnston's
      being to its very core. Branasko's face was aglow with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand, glorious!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;but if only you could see the lightning
      and the dawn in the east you would remember it all your life. The sunlight
      is cut off from Alpha by the clouds, and there is no light except the
      wonderful effects in the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston had gone back to the wheel and was examining it curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mind to turn off the current for a moment anyway,&rdquo; he said
      doggedly; &ldquo;if the sun is hidden they would not discover it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko came to him, a weird look of interest in his eyes. &ldquo;That is
      true,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;besides, what matters it? We may not live to see another
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston acted on a sudden impulse. He intended only to frighten Branasko
      by moving the wheel slightly, and he had turned it barely an eighth of an
      inch, when, as if controlled by some powerful spring, it whirled round at
      a great rate, making a loud rattling noise. To their dismay the light went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! what have I done?&rdquo; gasped the American in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled our fate, I have no doubt,&rdquo; muttered the Alphian from the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston had recoiled from the whirling wheel, and now cautiously groped
      back to it, and attempted to turn it. It would not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has caught some way,&rdquo; he groaned under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we have no light to find the cause of the trouble,&rdquo; added the
      Alphian, who had knelt down and was feeling about the wheel. Presently he
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I cannot understand it. The machinery is
      somewhere inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has grown colder,&rdquo; shuddered Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were warmed by the light, of course,&rdquo; remarked Branasko, &ldquo;and now we
      feel the dampness more. We are going at a frightful speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a jar, and the sun swung so violently from side to
      side that the two men were prostrated on the floor. The speed seemed to
      slacken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we are going to stop,&rdquo; groaned the American, and he sat up
      and held to Branasko. &ldquo;Perhaps they will draw us back to rectify the
      mistake, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be done,&rdquo; interrupted the Alphian. &ldquo;The machinery runs only one
      way. We shall simply have to finish our journey in darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may catch us on the other side before the sun starts back through
      the tunnel,&rdquo; suggested the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unlikely,&rdquo; returned Branasko. &ldquo;There, we are going ahead again. One
      thing in our favor is that we can more easily escape capture in darkness
      than if the sun were shining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the sun stop before entering the tunnel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Branasko; &ldquo;perhaps somebody will be there to see
      what is wrong with the light. We must have our wits about us when we
      land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston was looking over the edge of the platform. &ldquo;If the king's display
      is taking place down there I can see no sign of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of us!&rdquo; ejaculated Branasko. &ldquo;Of course, clouds sufficiently
      dense to hide the sun from Alpha would also prevent us from seeing the
      display below. I ought to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a grand outburst of harmony. The whole earth seemed
      to vibrate with sublime melody. &ldquo;Our blunder has not been discovered yet,&rdquo;
       finished Branasko, after a pause, &ldquo;else the fete down below would have
      been over. I am cold; shall we go inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston's answer was taken out of his mouth by a loud rattling beneath
      the floor, near the wheel he had just turned; the sun shook spasmodically
      for an instant, and its entire surface was faintly illuminated, but the
      light failed signally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been an extra current of electricity sent to relight the
      lamps,&rdquo; remarked Johnston; and, as he concluded, the sun trembled again,
      and another flash and failure occurred. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried the American, &ldquo;the
      clouds are thinning; see the lights below! They have discovered the
      accident!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both leaned over the railing and looked below. As far as the eye
      could reach, within the arc of their vision, they could see fitful lights
      flashing up, here and there, and going out again. And then they heard
      faint sounds of crashing masonry and the condensed roar of human voices,
      which seemed to come from above rather than from below. The Alphian
      turned. &ldquo;I cannot stand the cold,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston followed him. The rapid motion of the swinging sphere made him
      dizzy, and he caught Branasko's arm to keep from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we tell when we go over the wall?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to guess at it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;At any rate we must be
      near the lower door so as to get out quickly if it is necessary to do so
      to escape detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness they slowly made their way down the stairs to the great
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ought to be some way of making a light,&rdquo; said the Alphian, and his
      voice sounded loud and hollow in the empty chamber. After several failures
      to find the stairs they descended to the door they had entered. Branasko
      opened it a little, and a breeze came in. They sat down on the stone, and
      after a while, in sheer fatigue, they fell asleep. Hours passed. Branasko
      rose with a start, and shook Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our speed is lessening,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We must be going down. Be ready
      to jump out the instant we stop. There, let me open the door wider.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Tradmos spoke the words of warning, Thorndyke put his arm round the
      princess and drew her after Tradmos, who was hastening away in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said, drawing back. &ldquo;Let us not get excited. We are really as
      safe here as there; for in their madness they will kill one another and
      trample them under foot.&rdquo; She led him to a parapet overlooking the great
      court below. &ldquo;Hear them,&rdquo; she said, in pity, &ldquo;listen to their blows and
      cries. That was a woman's voice, and some man must have struck her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what is best to do,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;I want to protect you,
      but I am helpless; I don't know which way to turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said simply, and the Englishman thought she drew closer to
      him, as if touched by his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crash of timbers&mdash;a massive door had fallen&mdash;a
      scrambling of feet on the stone pavement, and they could see the dark
      human mass surging into the court through the corridors leading from the
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; asked Thorn dyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank from the parapet as if she had been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tearing the pillars down,&rdquo; she replied aghast; &ldquo;this part of the palace
      will fall. Oh, what can be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a grinding of stone upon stone, a mad yell from an hundred
      throats, the crash of glass, and, with a thunderous sound, a colossal
      pillar fell to the earth. The roof beneath the feet of the princess and
      Thorndyke trembled and sagged, and the tiling split and showered about
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising Bernardino in his arms, as if she were an infant, Thorndyke sprang
      toward the stairway leading to his chambers, but the roof had sunken till
      it was steep and slippery. One instant he was toppling over backward, the
      next, by a mighty effort, he had recovered his equilibrium, and finally
      managed to reach a safer place. As he hurried on another pillar went down.
      The roof sagged lower, and an avalanche of mortar and tiling slid into the
      court below. Yells, groans, and cries of fury rent the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernardino had fainted. Thorndyke tried to restore her to consciousness,
      but dared not put her from him for an instant. On he ran, and presently
      reached a flight of stairs which he thought led to his chambers. He
      descended them, and was hastening along a narrow corridor on the floor
      beneath when Bernardino opened her eyes. She asked to be released from his
      arms. He put her down, but supported her along the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have lost our way,&rdquo; he said, as he discovered that the corridor,
      instead of leading to his chambers, turned off obliquely in another
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go on anyway,&rdquo; she suggested; &ldquo;it may lead us out. I have never
      been here before. I&mdash;&rdquo; A great crash drowned her words. The floor
      quivered and swayed, but it did not fall. On they ran through the
      darkness, till Thorndyke felt a heavy curtain before. He paused abruptly,
      not knowing what to do. Bernardino felt of its texture, perplexed for an
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw it aside, it seems to hang across the corridor,&rdquo; she said. He obeyed
      her, and only a few yards further on they saw another curtain with bars of
      light above and below it. They drew this aside, and found themselves on
      the threshold of a most beautiful apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mosaic floor were pictures cut in colored stones, and the ceiling
      was a silken canopy as filmy and as delicately blue as the sky on a
      summer's night. The floor was strewn with richly embroidered pillows,
      couches, rugs and ottomans; and here and there were palm trees and beds of
      flowers and grottoes. A solitary light, representing the moon, showed
      through the silken canopy in whose folds little lights sparkled like
      far-off stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke looked at the princess inquiringly. She was bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea where we are,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I am sure I have never been
      here before; but there is another apartment beyond. Listen! I hear cries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one in distress,&rdquo; he answered, and he drew her across the room and
      through a door into another room more beautiful than the one they had just
      left. Here, huddled together at a window overlooking the court, were six
      or eight beautiful young women. They were staring out into the darkness,
      and moaning and muttering low cries of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my father's ladies,&rdquo; ejaculated the princess aghast. &ldquo;He would be
      angry if he knew we had come here. No one but himself enters these
      apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then one of the women turned a lovely and despairing face toward
      them, and came forward and knelt at the feet of Bernardino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, save us, Princess,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm,&rdquo; said the princess, touching the white brow of the woman. &ldquo;The
      danger may soon pass; this portion of the palace is too strongly built for
      them to injure it.&rdquo; Then she turned to Thorndyke: &ldquo;We must hasten on and
      find our way down; it would never do for us to be seen here.&rdquo; Then she
      turned to the kneeling woman and said gently: &ldquo;I hope you will say nothing
      to the king of this; we lost our way in trying to get down from the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; gladly promised the woman, and seeing that Bernardino knew
      not which way to turn, she guided them to a door opening into a
      dimly-lighted corridor. &ldquo;It will take you out to the balconies and down to
      the audience-chamber,&rdquo; she said. The princess thanked her, and she and the
      Englishman descended several flights of stairs. Reaching one of the
      balconies they met the denser darkness of the outside and the deafening
      clang and clamor of the multitude. There was no light of any kind, and
      Thorndyke and his charge had to press close against the balustrade of the
      balcony to keep from being crushed by the mad torrent of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then a strident voice would rise above the din:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the palace! Death to the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trumpet in the tower sounded again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my father trying to attract their attention,&rdquo; explained the
      princess. &ldquo;Something very serious has happened for once. In speaking of
      the time the sun went out before, he told me that he had made an invention
      which, in such a crisis, would instantly restore confidence to the people.
      I cannot understand why he does not use it. Oh, I am afraid they will kill
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke tried to console her, for he saw that she was weeping, but just
      then there was a strange lull in the general tumult. What could have
      happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dawn! the ideal dawn!&rdquo; cried Bernardino, pointing to the eastern sky.
      Thorndyke looked in wonder. A purple light had spread along the horizon,
      and as it gradually softened into gray and slowly turned to pink, the
      noise of the populace died down. No sound could now be heard save the low
      groans of wounded men and women. What a sight met the view as the
      rose-light shimmered over the city! The dead and dying lay under the feet
      of the crowd. Almost every creature bore some mark of violence. Eyes were
      blood-shot, clothing torn, limbs were bleeding, and mingled fury and
      sudden hope struggled in each ashen face. The young trees and shrubbery
      had been trampled under foot, and walls, arcades and triumphal arches had
      been thrown down. The fragments of statues lay here and there, and the
      bodies of human beings filled the basins of broken fountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the sun,&rdquo; explained Bernardino; &ldquo;but the invention my father
      spoke of. He is doing it to calm them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke made no answer. He stood as if transfixed, gazing at the
      horizon. The rose-light had spread over a third of the sky when gradually
      there appeared in its centre a bright circle of yellow light. The yellow
      light faded, leaving a perfect picture of the throne of the king; and as
      the now silent masses looked at the picture, a curtain behind the throne
      parted and the king himself appeared. He advanced and sat on the throne,
      and turned a calm face towards his subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; ejaculated Bernardino, and her face was full of hope. &ldquo;See
      what he will do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the picture?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke; &ldquo;can it be seen by all of&mdash;of
      the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by all Alpha, for it is on the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke said nothing further, for the king had stood up, and with hands
      out-stretched was bowing. Above the circle of light, as if cut out of the
      solid blackness, in flaming letters stood the word,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SILENCE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was silence. Even the lips of the wounded men closed as the king
      began to speak. The sound of his voice seemed as far away as the stars,
      and to permeate all space:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All danger is over. Tidings from the west state that the sun is setting.
      No harm has come to it. It will rise in the morning, and the moon and
      stars will be out in a few hours. Let the dead be removed, the wounded
      cared for, and everything be repaired. This is my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. The king bowed sedately and retired from the throne, and the
      circle and pink glow faded from the black sky. The stillness was unbroken
      for a moment, then glad murmurings were heard in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lighting the palace,&rdquo; cried the princess. &ldquo;See, down there is
      the arcade leading to the rotunda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad it is over,&rdquo; said Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grasped his arm and impulsively looked into his face. &ldquo;But your
      friend, we have forgotten him, and done nothing to save him, and now it is
      too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not help it; we had to think of our own safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall send for Captain Tradmos and try to devise some other plan,&rdquo; she
      said, as they descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should not be seen together,&rdquo; she added, as they approached the
      throne-room; &ldquo;besides, you ought to go to your chambers. No one is allowed
      to be out when the dead is being removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the dead taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the wall, to be burned in the internal fires,&rdquo; she concluded, as she
      was leaving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found everything in order in his rooms and he lay down and tried to
      sleep, but he was too much excited over the happenings of the day. Hours
      must have passed when his attention was drawn to a bright light shining on
      the wall of his room. He went to a window and looked out on the court. The
      light came from the rising moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below lay the ruins of fallen columns, capitals, cornices and statues.
      Figures in black cloaks and cowls were removing the dead from the debris.
      With a fluttering sound something swooped down past his window to the
      ground. It looked like a great bird, carrying the car of a flying-machine.
      Thorndyke watched its circular descent to the earth, and shuddered with
      horror as the black figures filled the car with bodies and the gruesome
      machine spread its wings and rose slowly till it was clear of the domes
      and pinnacles of the palace, and then flew away westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other machines came, and, one after another, received their ghastly
      burdens and departed. In a short time all the dead was removed, and
      hundreds of workmen came from the palace and began repairing the fallen
      masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke went back to his couch and tried to sleep, but in vain. Slowly
      the hours of night passed, and as the purple of dawn rose in the east he
      dressed himself and went up on the roof. The moon had gone down and the
      stars were fading from the sky. The dark earth below showed no signs of
      life; but as the purple light softened into gray he saw that the streets
      of the city were filled with silent expectant people, all watching the
      eastern sky. And, as the gray light flushed into rose, and the rose began
      to scintillate with gold, they began to stir, and a hum of joyful voices
      was heard. The promised day had come.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The sun was, indeed, slowing up. The two men peered out at the door.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be unlucky for us if it should not come so near to the earth as
      it did on the other side,&rdquo; whispered Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly feel any motion to the thing at all,&rdquo; replied the American.
      &ldquo;Look! for some reason it is not so dark below. I can see the rocks.
      Surely we have already passed over the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; returned the Alphian. &ldquo;Come; we must be quick and watch our
      opportunity to land. I can't imagine where the light comes from unless it
      be from the people waiting for the arrival of the sun.&rdquo; Every instant the
      speed was lessening. Overhead the cables were beginning to creak and
      groan, and, now and then, the great globe swung perilously near some tall
      stony peak, or passed under a mighty stalactite. Slower and slower it got
      till, when within a few feet of the ground, it stopped its onward motion
      and only swung back and forth like a pendulum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; whispered Branasko, &ldquo;we must get down while it is swinging, no
      time to lose&mdash;not an instant!&rdquo; And as the sun moved backward, with
      his hand on the doorsill, he leaped to the earth. Johnston followed him.
      They were not a moment too soon, for about fifty yards away they saw a
      body of sixty or seventy men with lights in their hands hastening toward
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; exulted Branasko, and he quickly drew Johnston into a
      little cave in the face of a cliff. Crouching behind a great rock, they
      saw and heard the men as they approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them walked around the sun, and two, evidently in authority,
      entered the door. The others were placing ladders against the side of the
      sphere, when suddenly there was a loud clattering in the interior, a
      whirling of wheels under the platform above, and the surface of the sun
      burst into light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two refugees were momentarily blinded. Branasko had the presence of
      mind to quickly draw his companion down close to the earth behind the
      rock. &ldquo;They could see us in the light,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a joyous clamoring of voices among the men, and they withdrew
      several yards to look at the sun. This drew them nearer the hiding-place
      of the two refugees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an accident,&rdquo; said a voice; &ldquo;it won't happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then one of them went into the sun and the lights died out. In a moment
      the sun began to move. Slowly and majestically it swept over the rocky
      earth, followed by the crowd, till it reached a great hole and sank into
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone into the tunnel,&rdquo; said the Alphian, as the crowd disappeared behind
      the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo; asked Johnston. &ldquo;We certainly can't go through
      with the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till the next trip,&rdquo; grimly replied Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumbling noise from the big hole gradually died away, and the two men
      left their hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Johnston. He pointed to the west, where a red light
      shone against the towering cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the internal fires,&rdquo; answered Branasko, with a noticeable
      shudder. &ldquo;Let's go nearer; I have heard that there is a point near here
      where one can look down into the Lake of Flame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lake of Flame!&rdquo; echoed the American, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is where all
      of the dead of Alpha is cast by the black 'vultures of death.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston said nothing, for it was difficult to keep up with the Alphian,
      who was bounding over rocks and dangerous fissures toward the red glow in
      the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every step the atmosphere got warmer, and they detected a slight
      gaseous odor in the air. Finally, after an arduous tramp of an hour, they
      climbed up a steep hill and looked sharply down into a vast bubbling lake
      of molten matter more than a thousand yards below. Branasko noticed a
      stone weighing several tons evenly balanced on the verge of the great
      gulf, and pushed it with both his hands. It rocked, broke loose from its
      slender hold on the cliff and bounded out into the red space. Down it
      went, lessen-ing as it sank till it became a mere black speck and then
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where the dead go,&rdquo; said Branasko gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the American, happening to glance up, saw something like a huge
      black bird with outspread wings circling about in the red light over the
      pit. Branasko saw it, too, and his face paled and a tremolo was in his
      voice when he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of the 'vultures of death;' don't stir; we won't be seen if we
      remain where we are!&rdquo; The strange machine sank lower over the lake of
      fire, till, as if buoyed up on the hot air, with faintly quivering wings,
      it paused. A man opened a door of the black car and carelessly threw out
      the bodies of a woman and a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bodies whirled over and over and disappeared in the pit, and the man
      closed the door. The machine then rose and gracefully winged its flight to
      the east. In a moment others came with their grim burdens, and still
      others, till the mouth of the pit was dark with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; whispered Branasko, &ldquo;some great calamity, for
      surely so many people do not die in Alpha in a single day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an hour they watched the coming and going of the vultures, till,
      finally the last one hovered over the lake of fire. Suddenly the machine
      swerved so near to Branasko and Johnston that they shrank close to the
      earth to keep from being seen. Something was evidently wrong with the
      machine, for there was a wild look of desperation on the driver's face as
      he tugged excitedly at the pilot-wheel. But all his efforts only caused
      the air-ship to dart irregularly from side to side, and, now and then, to
      strike the rocks of the pit's mouth, to shoot up suddenly, or to sink
      dangerously down toward the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is losing control of it,&rdquo; whispered Branasko, &ldquo;he does not know what
      to do. See, he is trying to lighten the load, by kicking out the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was true, and, as the machine made a sudden plunge toward the cliff a
      few yards to the left of the refugees, the dead body, which the driver had
      managed to move to the door with his feet, fell out and lodged upon the
      edge of the cliff instead of falling into the fiery depths. The machine
      bounded up a few yards and paused, now apparently under the control of its
      driver. The man looked down hesitatingly at the corpse for a moment and
      then lowered the machine to the sloping rock near where the body lay. He
      alighted and cautiously crept down the steep incline to the body. He
      raised it in his arms and was about to cast it from him when his foot
      slipped, and with a cry of horror he fell with his burden over the cliff's
      edge into the red abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston uttered an exclamation of horror, but Branasko was unmoved. After
      a moment he rose, and carefully scanning the space overhead, he crawled on
      hands and knees toward the machine. Johnston heard him chuckling to
      himself and uttering spasmodic laughs, and he watched him closely as he
      reached the machine. For several minutes he seemed to be inspecting it
      critically, both inside and out; then he stood away from it, a bold, black
      silhouette on a background of flame, and motioned the American to come to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston promptly, but not without many misgivings, obeyed his signal.
      &ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; asked he, as the Alphian assisted him to rise from
      his hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Branasko touched the machine and smiled. His face was shining with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question of our returning to Alpha is settled,&rdquo; he said
      sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily; that fellow must have been drunk; the machine is in good order, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you propose to start?&rdquo; and the American eyed the funeral-car
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is before us; we could not get a better time.&rdquo; As he spoke he
      entered the car and laid his hand on the wheel. Johnston, obeying his nod,
      followed, shuddering as he remarked the traces of blood on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Branasko turned the wheel slowly, and the wings outside began
      to flap, and the car mounted into the air like a startled bird and flew
      out quickly over the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Branasko bit his lip, and Johnston heard him stifle an exclamation of
      impatience. As for the American, he was at once thrilled and fascinated by
      the awful sight below; he could now see beneath the overhanging mouth of
      the pit, and look far down into a boundless lake of molten matter that
      seemed as restless as an ocean in a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the air became so hot he could hardly breathe. He looked at the
      Alphian in alarm. The latter was whirling the wheel first one way and then
      another with a startled look of fear in his eyes, and then Johnston
      noticed that the walls of the pit were rising about them, and the black
      canopy overhead rapidly receding.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sinking down into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost wild with terror, the American sprang toward the wheel, but
      Branasko pushed him away roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; he ordered gruffly. &ldquo;It is the heat; let me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American sank into his seat. The heat became more and more intense.
      Both men were purple in the face, and the perspiration was rolling from
      their bodies in streams. Down sank the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't manage it,&rdquo; said Branasko hoarsely, &ldquo;we'd as well give up.&rdquo; Just
      then Johnston noticed the mouth of a cave behind Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;can't we get into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko looked over his shoulder, and, as he saw the cave, he uttered a
      glad cry. He quickly turned the wheel and drew out a lever at his right.
      The machine obeyed instantly; it swerved round suddenly and dived into the
      cave. The cool air soon revived them, and Branasko had little trouble in
      bringing the car to a resting-place on the rocky floor of the cave. Before
      them hung impenetrable darkness, behind a curtain of red light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in a pretty pickle now,&rdquo; said Johnston despondently, as they
      alighted from the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to do but to make the best of it,&rdquo; sighed Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this cave may lead out into some place of safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston's eyes had become somewhat accustomed to the gloom, and he began
      to peer into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a light,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;it cannot be a reflection from the fire in
      the pit, for it is whiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Alphian gazed at it steadily for a moment, then he said decidedly: &ldquo;We
      must go and see what it is.&rdquo; Without another word he started toward the
      white, star-like spot, sliding his hand over the rocky wall, and springing
      over a fissure in the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the light grew brighter, till, as they suddenly rounded a cliff,
      a grand sight burst upon their view. They found themselves in a vast
      dome-shaped cavern, thousands of yards in diameter and height. And almost
      in the centre of the floor, from a red and purple mound of cooling lava,
      leapt a white stream of molten matter from the floor to the dome. And in
      the black dome, where the lava turned to molten spray, hung countless
      stalactites of every color known to the artistic eye. And from the foot of
      the fountain ran a tortuous rivulet that lighted the walls and roof of a
      narrow chamber that extended for miles down toward the bowels of the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Branasko was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king does not know of this,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;else he would make it
      accessible to his people, and call it one of the wonders of Alpha. By
      accidentally sinking into the pit we have discovered it. But,&rdquo; he
      concluded, &ldquo;we must at once try to find some way out other than that by
      which we came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned from the beautiful fountain, and, holding to each other's
      hands, and aided by the light behind them, they stumbled laboriously
      through the semi-darkness. Branasko's ears were very acute. He paused to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye!&rdquo; he cautioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combined roar of the pit and the fountain of lava had sunk to a low
      murmur, but ahead of them they now heard a rushing sound like a distant
      tornado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the Alphian, and he drew his companion after him with an
      eagerness the American was slow to understand. The light in the cavern
      gradually grew brighter. By a circuitous route they were again approaching
      the pit of fire, though it was still hidden from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally they reached a point where the wind was blowing stiffly, and
      further on a volume of cold spray suddenly dashed upon them and wet them
      to the skin. And when their eyes had become accustomed to the rolling
      mist, they saw a great lake, and pouring into it from high above was a
      mighty waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; ejaculated the Alphian, in great alarm. &ldquo;If this is salt water we
      are lost. All Alpha will come to an end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; And Johnston wondered if Branasko's trials and
      struggle could have turned his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be salt water, then it has broken in from the ocean above Alpha,&rdquo;
       he explained. &ldquo;The king has often said that not a drop of the ocean has
      ever entered the great cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko stooped and wet his hand in a little pool at his feet. &ldquo;I am
      almost afraid to taste it,&rdquo; said he, holding his hand near his mouth. &ldquo;It
      would settle all our fates.&rdquo; He waited a moment and then touched his
      fingers to his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; That was all he said for several moments. He folded his arms and
      looked mutely toward the boiling lake. Presently he raised his eyes to the
      great hole in the roof, and groaned: &ldquo;The break is gradually widening.
      These stones are freshly broken, and the great bowl is filling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will fill all Alpha with water and drown every soul in it,&rdquo; added the
      terrified American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, however, is not the most immediate danger,&rdquo; said Branasko wisely.
      &ldquo;They would first suffocate, and later their bodies would be swallowed up
      in the stomach of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;As soon as this bowl is filled with
      water, which would not take many hours, it would run over into the lake of
      fire and produce an explosion that would rend Alpha from end to end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows, it might turn the whole Atlantic into the centre of the earth,
      and destroy the entire earth.&rdquo; But Branasko was unable to grasp the full
      magnitude of the remark, for to him the world was simply a vast cavern
      lighted by human ingenuity. He fastened a narrow splinter of stone upright
      in the shallow water at his feet, and, lying down on his stomach with his
      eyes close to it, he studied it for several minutes. When he got up, a
      desperate gleam was in his dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rising fast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must attempt to get to the capitol and
      warn the king. It is possible that he may be able to stop the opening. The
      only thing left to us is to try our machine again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston found it hard to keep pace with him as he bounded out of the mist
      and on toward the faint glow ahead. Reaching the flying machine Branasko
      entered it and turned on a small electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he grunted with satisfaction, &ldquo;I have found a light. I can now see
      what is the matter with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston stood outside and heard him hammering on the metal parts in the
      car, and became so absorbed in thinking of the peril of their position
      that he was startled when Branasko cried out to him:&mdash;&ldquo;All right. I
      think we can make it do; a pin has lost out, but perhaps I can hold the
      piece in place with my foot. If only we can stand the heat of the pit long
      enough to rise above it, we may escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston followed him into the car. Branasko seated himself firmly and
      gave the wheel a little turn. Slowly the machine rose. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; cried
      Branasko, &ldquo;it is under control. We must not be too hasty. Now for the
      pit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the American was in his mouth as the long black wings waved
      up and down and the air-ship, like some live thing, shuddered and swept
      gracefully out of the mouth of the cave into the glare and heat of the
      pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your breath!&rdquo; yelled Branasko, and he bent lower into the car to
      escape the shower of hot ashes that was falling about them. Far out over
      the lake in a straight line they glided, and there came to a sudden halt.
      Johnston's eyes were glued on his companion's face. Branasko sat doubled
      up, every muscle drawn, his eyes bulging from their sockets. Would he be
      strong enough? To Johnston everything seemed in a whirl. The walls of the
      pit were rising around them.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thorndyke went down into his chambers to make his toilet and was ready to
      leave when there was a soft rap on his door. He opened it, and to his
      surprise saw Bernardino modestly draw herself back into the shadow of the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but I must speak to you,&rdquo; she stammered in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, going out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to advise you to avoid my father to-day. He is greatly
      disappointed with the accident of yesterday, and he is never courteous to
      strangers when he is displeased. He was particularly anxious to have you
      entertained by the fete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I shall keep out of his way,&rdquo; promised the Englishman. &ldquo;Where
      had I better stay&mdash;here in my rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he might send for you. If you would care to see Winter Park, I can go
      with you as your guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted; nothing could please me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; (as a servant passed in the room with a tray) &ldquo;that is your
      breakfast. Meet me at the fountain at the north entrance of the palace in
      half an hour.&rdquo; And, drawing her veil over her face, she vanished in the
      darkness of the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had breakfasted and sent the man away, he hastened below to the
      place designated by the princess. She was waiting for him under the palm
      trees, and was so disguised that he would not have known her but for her
      low amused laugh as he was about to pass her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not do for any one to suspect me,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;my father
      would never forgive me for doing this.&rdquo; She pointed to a flying-machine
      near by. &ldquo;We must take the air; I have made all the arrangements. Winter
      Park is beyond the limits of the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her across the grass to the machine and into the car. They
      could see the driver behind the glass of the narrow compartment in which
      he sat, and when he turned the polished metal wheel the machine rose like
      a liberated balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke looked out of the window. The blue haze of the fifth hour of the
      morning was breaking over everything, and as the domes, pinnacles, and
      vari-colored roofs fell away in the beautiful light, the breast of the
      Englishman heaved with delightful emotions. Bernardino was watching his
      face with a gratified smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like Alpha,&rdquo; she said, half anxiously, half inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I want to show you the great world I came
      from;&mdash;and some day perhaps I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood ran into her cheeks suddenly, and then as quickly receded,
      leaving a wistful expression in her eyes. She sighed. &ldquo;It has been my
      dream for a long time. I have always imagined that it is more wonderful
      than Alpha; but you know there is no chance for you to return now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall manage to escape some way and you shall go with me as my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her blushes came again. &ldquo;I did not know that you cared that much for me,&rdquo;
       she said. Then, as if to change the subject, she pointed through the
      window. &ldquo;See, we are approaching the Park, and shall descend in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window and then drew his head in quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are coming down into a big lake!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Oh, no, it is only
      the glass roof of the park,&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;true, it does look like water
      in the sunlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The machine sank lower and finally rested on a plot of grass in a little
      square ornamented with beds of flowers and white statues. Thorndyke saw a
      seemingly endless wall, so high that he could not calculate its height.
      Bernardino preceded him in at a great arching door in the wall, and they
      found themselves in a stone-paved vestibule several hundred feet square.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid servant came forward at once and brought heavy fur clothing for
      them and invited them into separate toilet rooms. When he came out
      Bernardino was waiting for him. He could hardly breathe, so thick were the
      furs he had put on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is warm here, but it will be colder in a moment,&rdquo; said the princess.
      And she led him to a door across the room. When the door was opened,
      Thorndyke uttered an exclamation of astonishment. Before their eyes lay a
      wide expanse of snow-covered roads, woodlands and frozen lakes and
      streams. The air was as crisp and invigorating as a Canadian winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernardino led him to a pavilion where a number of pleasure-seekers were
      gathered and selected a sleigh and two mettlesome horses. She took the
      reins from the man, and sprang lightly into the graceful cutter. Thorndyke
      followed her and wrapped the thick robes about her feet. Away they sped
      like the wind down the smooth road, through a leafless forest. Overhead
      the glass roof could not be seen, but a lowering gray cloud hung over them
      and a light snow was falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winter Park is a great resort,&rdquo; the princess explained; &ldquo;we get tired of
      the unchanging climate, and it is pleasant to visit such a place as this.
      There is a winter park in every town of any size in Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove along the shore of a beautiful lake, on the frozen surface of
      which hundreds of skaters were darting here and there, and passed
      hillsides on which crowds of young people were coasting in sleds. When
      they had driven about ten miles in a circuitous route she turned the
      horses round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better return,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you have not seen all of the Park, but
      we can visit it some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside they found their flying-machine awaiting them, and were soon on
      the way back to the city. They parted at the fountain in the park, she
      hastening to the palace, and he turning to stroll through the little wood
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing a thick bunch of trees when he was startled by hearing his
      name called. He turned round, but at first saw no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thorndyke!&rdquo; There it was again, and then he saw a hand beckoning to him
      from a hedge of ferns at his right. He stepped back a few paces; a man
      came out of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Johnston, his face was white and haggard, his clothing rent and
      soiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, can it be you?&rdquo; gasped the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody else,&rdquo; groaned Johnston, cautiously advancing and laying a
      trembling hand on the arm of Thorndyke; &ldquo;but don't talk loud, they will
      find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston pointed first to the east, and then swept his hand over the sky
      to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the wall,&rdquo; he said despondently. &ldquo;From the dead lands behind the
      sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get back here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply Johnston parted the fern leaves and pointed to the lank figure
      of the tall Alphian, who lay curled up on the grass as if asleep. &ldquo;He
      brought me in that flying-machine there; but he has spent all his strength
      in trying to manage the thing, which was out of order, and now he is
      helpless. Twice we came within an inch of sinking down into the internal
      fires. The last time we escaped only by the breadth of a hair; if he had
      not had the endurance of a man of iron he would have succumbed to the heat
      and we would have been lost. We sank so far down that I became insensible
      and never knew a thing till the fresh air revived me. See, my beard and
      hair are singed, and look how he is blistered. Poor fellow! He is a hero.&rdquo;
       Johnston stepped back and shook the Alphian, but the poor fellow's head
      only rolled to one side, showing his bloodshot eyes. He was insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in a bad fix,&rdquo; said Thorndyke; &ldquo;where did he come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banished like myself; we met over there in the dark and roamed about
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I was following his lead. We will both be put to death if
      we are discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not tell you his plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston started visibly. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He declares that
      all this vast cavern is in danger. Over in the west we discovered a hole
      in the roof through which the ocean is streaming in a torrent. He
      calculated that before many hours the water would overflow into the
      internal fires and produce a volcanic eruption that will swallow up all of
      Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heaven! and you are hiding here at such a moment? The king must
      be informed at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston had grown suddenly paler. &ldquo;It may not be as bad as Branasko
      feared, and the king would have no mercy on me and him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said Thorndyke; &ldquo;I have made a good friend of the
      Princess Bernardino. She will tell me what is best to do. Remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In breathless haste, Thorndyke went into the audience chamber. Fortunately
      the king was not on his throne, and he caught sight of the confidential
      maid of the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him approaching, and withdrew behind a cluster of tall white jars
      of porcelain containing rare plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see your mistress,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell her to come to me at once; we
      are in great peril!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl swept her eyes over the balconies and the throne and said: &ldquo;She
      is in her apartments, sir; I shall bring her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her to meet me at the fountain where we last met,&rdquo; and he hastened
      back to the spot mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon came. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnston is back,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He is in the wood there with a fellow who
      escaped with him in a disabled flying-machine. He says the sea has broken
      through over in the west and is streaming into Alpha in a torrent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there is some mistake,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;such a thing has never
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been caused by the explosives during the storm,&rdquo; went on
      Thorndyke. &ldquo;Branasko, the Alphian who was with Johnston, says we are in
      imminent peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some mistake,&rdquo; she repeated incredulously, as she looked to
      westward. The green glow of the second hour of the afternoon lay over
      everything. She stood mute and motionless for a long time, looking
      steadily at the horizon; then she started suddenly, changed her position,
      and shaded her eyes from the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really does seem to me that there is a cloud rising, and it is unlike
      any cloud I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it too!&rdquo; cried the Englishman; &ldquo;it must be that the water has
      already reached the internal fires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernardino was very pale when she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father must know this at once; come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into the palace, through the vast rotunda, past the throne, and into the
      very apartment of the king himself she led him hastily. A royal attendant
      met them and held up his hands warningly. &ldquo;The king is asleep,&rdquo; he said in
      an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake him&mdash;wake him at once!&rdquo; commanded the excited girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, it would offend him,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pause an instant, but darting past the man and running to the
      king's couch, she drew the curtain aside and touched the sleeper. He waked
      in anger, but her first word disarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alpha is in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he growled, half awake. &ldquo;The sea is breaking through in the west,
      and running into the internal fires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dense cloud is rising in the west, and:&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; the word came from far down in his throat, and he was
      ghastly pale. He ran to the table and touched a button and, to the
      astonishment of Thorndyke, the walls on the western side of the room
      silently parted, showing a little balcony overlooking the street below.
      The king went hastily out and looked toward the west. The others followed
      him. The princess stifled a cry of alarm when she glanced at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great black, rolling clouds were rapidly spreading along the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at them as helplessly as a frightened child. &ldquo;The air!&rdquo; he
      groaned. &ldquo;It is hot!&rdquo; and then he held out his hand to the princess, and
      showed her a flake of soot on it, and he dumbly pointed to others that
      were falling about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you discover it?&rdquo; he asked, and Thorndyke saw that he was trying
      to appear calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;this gentleman's friend has returned from banishment, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Returned! has the wall been destroyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he accidentally discovered the danger, and came in a flying-machine
      to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? bring him to me, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand impatiently. &ldquo;Go; if Alpha is saved he shall be at
      liberty&mdash;if it is not, what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorndyke hastened away after Johnston, who, when he was told of the
      king's words, readily accompanied his friend to the presence of the ruler.
      They found him with his daughter still on the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you discover this?&rdquo; asked the king, turning to the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      As quickly as possible, Johnston related his adventures, and particularly
      the story of the shooting fountain and the fall of salt water. The king
      did not wait for him to conclude. He ran back into his chamber, touched
      another button, and the next instant alarm-bells were ringing all over the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A signal to the protectors,&rdquo; explained the princess to Thorndyke; &ldquo;by
      this time they are ringing all over Alpha. Oh, what will become of us?&rdquo; as
      she spoke she leaned over the balustrade and looked down into the street.
      Vast crowds had gathered and were motionless, except at points where the
      purple-clad &ldquo;protectors&rdquo; rushed from public buildings to assemble in
      squads on the street corner.

      Chapter XVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Bernardino turned to look after her father as he was leaving the room.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to the observatory,&rdquo; she said to Thorndyke and Johnston. &ldquo;Let
      us go also.&rdquo; And they followed the king into the room with the glass roof
      and walls covered with mirrors which he had shown the strangers several
      days before. A white-headed old man stood at the stand, his fingers
      trembling over the half circle of electric buttons. In a mirror before him
      he was studying the reflection of a town of perhaps a hundred houses. The
      streets were filled with excited citizens, and a squad of protectors stood
      ready for action near a row of flying-machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ornethelo,&rdquo; said the king, and at the sound of his voice the old man
      turned and bowed humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; went on the king, &ldquo;I will take your place a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the stand and touched a button. Instantly the scene changed;
      fields, forests, streams and hills ran by in a murky blur, and then a
      larger town flashed on the mirror. Here the same stir and alertness
      characterized the scene. The gaze of every inhabitant was fixed on the
      threatening horizon. Rapidly the scenes shifted at the king's will, till a
      hundred cities, towns and villages had been reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! They are all ready&mdash;all faithful,&rdquo; groaned the king, &ldquo;and,
      Ornethelo, they may all have to perish to-day, and all for our ambition.
      Poor mortals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ornethelo's face was half submerged in the beard on his breast, but he
      looked up suddenly and spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For their sakes, then, we ought not to delay; there may yet be hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Ornethelo.&rdquo; There was a ring of hope in the voice of the
      king. &ldquo;Quick! show me my capitol, that I may see if all the protectors are
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ornethelo touched another button, and, as if seen from a great height, the
      fair and wondrous city dawned before the eyes of the spectators. In every
      street policemen and protectors and flying-machines stood in orderly
      readiness. The housetops were colored with the variegated costumes of men,
      women and children. Over all lay the wondrous sunlight, through the green
      splendor of which the flakes of soot were falling like black snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king touched the old man's arm. &ldquo;I must see beyond the walls; are the
      connections made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try them; they must not fail me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man tremblingly unlocked a cabinet on the table, and another row
      of electric buttons was displayed. Ornethelo touched one. Immediately
      there was a sharp clicking sound under the stand, and the view was swept
      from the mirror. Nothing could be seen but a dark suggestion of towering
      cliffs and yawning caverns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the east, Ornethelo,&rdquo; cried the king impatiently. &ldquo;Go on! the west!
      the west!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black landscape flashed by like a glimpse of night from a flying
      train, and then a blur of redly illuminated smoke in rolling billows
      seemed to swell out from the surface of the mirror into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, slow!&rdquo; cried the king, and then a frightful scene burst upon their
      sight. They beheld a great belching pit of fire and flames. The sky from
      the earth to the zenith was a vast expanse of illuminated smoke, and the
      black landscape round about was cut by rivulets of molten lava rolling on
      and on like restless streams of quicksilver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king leaned against the stand as if faint with despair. &ldquo;Call Prince
      Arthur!&rdquo; he ordered, and almost at that instant the young man appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king pointed a quivering finger at the mirror, and said huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let not the sun go down! Let its light be white as at noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, it has never been done before; it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alpha has never faced such danger. All our dream is about to end. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the young man hastened away, and it seemed scarcely a
      moment before the sunlight streaming in at the oval glass roof changed
      from green to white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king pushed Ornethelo impatiently aside; his eyes held a dull gleam of
      despair, and he seemed to have grown ten years older. He touched a button,
      and the awful scene at the pit gave place to a bright view of the capitol,
      which was plainly seen from its crowded centre to its scattering suburbs.
      The squads of &ldquo;protectors&rdquo; stood like armies ready for battle, their rigid
      faces still toward the awful west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are ready&mdash;the signal!&rdquo; yelled the king, waving his hand, &ldquo;the
      signal!&rdquo; Ornethelo caught his breath suddenly and tottered as he went
      across the room, and touched a button on the wall. The king's eyes were
      glued on the mirrored view of the capitol, his trembling hands held out,
      as if commanding silence. Then a deafening trumpet blast broke on the ear.
      The masses of citizens pressed near the edges of the roofs and close
      against the walls along the streets, as the protectors rushed into the
      flying-machines. Another trumpet-blast, and away they flew, a long black
      line, every instant growing smaller as it receded in the murky distance.
      The princess, white and silent, led Thorndyke and Johnston back to the
      balcony. The line of machines was now a mere thread in the sky, but the
      ominous cloud in the west had increased, and fine sand and ashes were
      added to the fall of soot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; gasped the princess. It was a low rumble like distant
      thunder, and the balcony shook violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An earthquake,&rdquo; said Thorndyke. &ldquo;I am really afraid there is not a ghost
      of a chance for us; the water running into the fire is sure to cause an
      eruption of some sort, and even a slight one would be likely to enlarge
      the opening to the ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston nodded knowingly as he looked into his friend's face, but,
      considering the presence of the princess, he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, Prince Marentel, is the greatest man in our kingdom,&rdquo; she re
      marked. &ldquo;He has taken enough explosives to remove a mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will he use them?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, but I fancy he will try to close the opening in some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter slowly shook his head. &ldquo;I fear he will fail. The fall must be
      as voluminous as Niagara by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father must have lost hope, or he would not have stopped the sun,&rdquo;
       sighed the princess, and she cast a sad glance towards the west. The
      rolling clouds had become more dense, and the rumbling and booming in the
      distance was growing more frequent. A thin gray cloud passed before the
      sun, and a dim shadow fell over the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a natural cloud,&rdquo; said Thorndyke; &ldquo;it comes from the steam that
      rises from the pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly like our rain clouds,&rdquo; returned the princess; &ldquo;but it comes
      from the steam, as you say. But let us go into the Electric Auditorium and
      hear the news. As soon as anything is done we will hear of it there.&rdquo; The
      others had no time to question her, for she was hastening into the
      corridor outside. She piloted them down a flight of stairs into a large
      circular room beneath the surface of the ground. It was filled with seats
      like a modern theatre, and in the place where the stage would have been,
      stood a mighty mirror over an hundred feet square. She led them to a
      private box in front of the mirror. The room was filled from the first row
      of chairs to the rear with a silent, anxious crowd. In the massive frame
      of the mirror were numerous bell-shaped trumpets like those on the
      ordinary phonograph, though much larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch the mirror,&rdquo; whispered Bernardino as she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that instant the surface of the great glass began to glow like the
      sky at dawn, and all the lights in the room went out. Then from the
      trumpets in the frame came the loud ringing of musical bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are ready,&rdquo; whispered Bernardino; &ldquo;now watch and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pink light on the mirror faded, and a life-like reflection appeared&mdash;the
      reflection of a young man standing on a rock in bold relief against a dark
      background of rugged, slabbering cliffs and the forbidding mouths of
      caves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waldmeer!&rdquo; ejaculated the princess, and she relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man held in his hand a cup-shaped instrument from which extended
      a wire to the ground. He raised it to his lips, and instantly a calm,
      deliberate voice came from the mirror, soft and low and yet loud, enough
      to reach the most remote parts of the great room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ocean,&rdquo; began he, &ldquo;is pouring into the 'Volcano of the Dead' in a
      gradually increasing torrent. Prince Marentel hopes temporarily to delay
      the crisis by partially turning the torrent away from the pit into the
      lowlands of the country. For that purpose a portion of the endless wall is
      being torn down, and Marentel's forces are placing their explosives. After
      this is done an attempt will be made to stop the original break. There is,
      however, little hope. The prince has warned the king to be prepared for
      the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the speaker turned as if startled toward the red glare at
      his right. He quickly picked up another instrument attached to a wire and
      put it to his ear. A look of horror changed his face as he turned to the
      audience and began to speak:&mdash;&ldquo;The opening in the wall is not
      progressing rapidly. Workmen are drowning and the tunnel of the sun is
      filling with water. It will be impossible for the sun to go through to the
      east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a far-away crash, and instantly the mirror was void.
      There was now no sound except the low groans of women in the audience and
      the subdued curses of maddened men. The silence was profound. Then the
      mirror began to glow, and the image of another man took Waldmeer's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Mayor of Telmantio,&rdquo; whispered the princess, &ldquo;a place near the
      western limits of Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held a like instrument to the one used by Waldmeer, and through it
      spoke:&mdash;&ldquo;Venus, one of the great stars, has been shaken from the
      firmament. It fell in the suburbs of Telmantio, and many lives were lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all, and the figure vanished. Presently Waldmeer reappeared. He
      seemed to be standing nearer the pit, for the entire background was
      aflame; volumes of black smoke now and then hid him from view, and a thick
      shower of ashes and small stones were falling round him. He spoke, but his
      voice was drowned in a deafening explosion, and the whole landscape about
      him seemed afire. In the semi-darkness hundreds of protectors could be
      seen struggling in the rushing water, moving stones and building a dam.
      Waldmeer again faced his far-off audience and spoke:&mdash;&ldquo;Prince
      Marentel has turned the course of the stream. All now depends on the
      success or failure of his final test with explosives, which will take
      place in about half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to go outside again,&rdquo; suggested Bernardino, as Waldmeer's image
      disappeared; &ldquo;my father might want us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing no one in the king's apartment, they passed through it to the
      balcony. Half the sky was now covered with mingled fog and smoke, and the
      sun could be seen only now and then. A drizzling rain was falling&mdash;a
      rain that brought down clots of ashes and soot. But this made no
      difference to the throngs in the now muddy and slippery streets. They
      stood shivering in damp and soiled clothing, their blearing eyes fixed
      hopelessly on the lowering signs in the west. Johnston noticed a bent
      figure crouched against a wall beneath them. It was Branasko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; inquired the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Branasko, the companion of my adventures,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him to us,&rdquo; she said eagerly, and the American went down to the
      Alphian.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered together, Branasko uncovered his dishevelled head and
      bowed most humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look tired and sick and hungry; have you eaten anything today?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in two days,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess called to a frightened maid who was wringing her hands in a
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this man food and drink at once,&rdquo; she ordered, and Branasko, with a
      grateful bow and glance, withdrew. Johnston followed him to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the danger passes we are safe; the king has
      promised to pardon me, and he will do the same for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no hope for any of us,&rdquo; replied Branasko grimly; &ldquo;but I do not
      want to die with this gnawing in my stomach; adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the worst comes, is there any chance for us to escape from here to the
      outer world?&rdquo; the Englishman was asking the princess when Johnston turned
      back to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a few hundred, yes,&mdash;by the sub-water ships, but for all, no;
      and, then, my father would not consent to rescue a part and not the whole
      of his subjects. He would not try to save himself or any of his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clouds still covered the sun; but on the eastern sky its rays were
      shining gloriously. Ever and anon there sounded from afar a low rumbling
      as if the earth were swelling with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston left the two lovers together and went to the door of the Electric
      Auditorium, and over the heads of the breathless crowd he watched the
      great mirror. After a few moments Waldmeer appeared and spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Marentel is operating with great difficulty. A large quantity of
      his explosives has been injured by water, but he hopes there is enough
      left intact to serve his purpose. The final explosion will soon take
      place. The greatest peril hangs over Alpha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldmeer's reflection was becoming in-distinct, and sick at heart the
      American elbowed his way through the muttering crowd into the corridor.
      Here he met Branasko, and together they walked back to Thorndyke and the
      princess, who were mutely watching the signs in the east. Just then the
      sun slowly emerged from the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Bernardino in horror. &ldquo;The cloud is not moving; the sun has
      not stopped! It is going down and we shall soon be in utter darkness. Oh,
      it is awful&mdash;to die in this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king had just returned, and he over-heard her words. He came hastily
      to the edge of the balcony, and gazed at the sun. The others held their
      breath and waited. His face became more rigid; he swayed a little as he
      turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my daughter,&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;it is going down; the cowardly
      dogs in the east have deserted their posts. It is going down! It will sink
      into a tunnel filled with water, and the light of Alpha will be
      extinguished forever. We are undone! Say your prayers, my child, your
      prayers, I tell you, for an Infinite God is angry at our pretensions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't despair, father,&rdquo; and Bernardino put her arms gently round the old
      man's neck. &ldquo;You understand the solar machinery; could you not stop the
      sun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the old man flashed. He seemed electrified as he drew himself
      from her embrace and looked anxiously over the balustrade to a
      flying-machine in the street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might reach the east in time,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;yes, you are right, I was
      acting cowardly. The fastest air-ship in Alpha is ready, and Nanleon can
      drive it to its utmost speed. If the worst comes, I shall see you no more,
      good-bye!&rdquo; He kissed her brow tenderly, and her eyes filled as he hastened
      away. Down below they saw him spring lightly into the gold-mounted car,
      and the next instant the graceful vessel rose above the palace roof and
      sped like an arrow across the sky toward the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint cheer broke from the lips of the crowd which seemed suddenly to
      take new hope from the king's departure. Some of them waved their hats and
      scarfs, and many watched the air-ship till it had disappeared in the murky
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may not get there in time!&rdquo; cried the princess; &ldquo;it seems to be going
      down faster than it ever did before, and he has a great distance to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little party on the balcony were silent for a long time. Presently
      Bernardino turned her tearful eyes to the face of Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smoke and steam do not seem so voluminous, do you think all will go
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman slowly shook his head. &ldquo;I don't want to depress you more
      than you are; but I think at such a time we ought to realize the worst. It
      is true, the clouds are not so heavy, and the earth-quakes are less
      frequent, but, unfortunately, it is owing to the fact that the volume of
      water has been turned away from the pit into the tunnel. Be prepared for
      the worst. If your father cannot reach the machinery in the east soon
      enough, our light will go out; and, worse than that, if Prince Marentel
      should fail in his next venture with explosives, all hope will be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never desired to live so much as now,&rdquo; she answered, inclining
      with an air of tenderness toward him. &ldquo;I never knew what it was to fear
      death till&mdash;till you came to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. There was a lump in his throat and he could not trust
      his voice to speech. Branasko and Johnston left them together to go into
      the Electric Auditorium. They returned in great haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince is ready for the explosion,&rdquo; panted Johnston. &ldquo;Thorndyke, old
      man, this is simply awful! It is not like standing up to be shot at, or
      being jerked through the clouds in a balloon. It seems to me that out
      there is the endless space of infinity, and that all the material world is
      coming to an end. My God! look at that hellish fire, the awful smoke and
      that black sky! Oh, the blasphemy of a such a paltry imitation of the
      handiwork of the Creator! We are damned! I say damned, and by a just and
      angry God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool,&rdquo; said Thorndyke, and he threw a warning glance at
      Bernardino, who, with staring, distended eyes was listening to Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is right,&rdquo; she said in a low tone. &ldquo;I have never seen your world,
      but I know my people must be woefully wrong. In your land they say men
      teach things about Infinity and an eternal life for the soul; and that one
      may prepare for that life by living pure, and in striving to attain a high
      spiritual state. Oh, why have you not told me about that? It is the one
      important thing. I have long wanted to know if my soul will be safe at
      death, but I can learn nothing of my people. They have always tried to
      rival God, and, in their mad pursuit of perfection in science, they have
      been reduced to&mdash;this. That black cloud is the frown of God, hose mad
      flames may burst forth at any moment and engulf us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a low groan and hung her head as if in prayer. Johnston and
      Thorndyke were awed to silence. Never had the Englishman loved her as at
      that moment. She was no longer simply a beautiful human creature, but a
      divinity, speaking truths from Heaven itself. He felt too unworthy to
      stand in her presence, and yet his heart was aching to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her pallid face heavenward and extended her fair, fragile hands
      toward the lowering sky and began to pray. &ldquo;My Creator,&rdquo; she said
      reverently, childishly, &ldquo;I have never come to Thee, but they say that
      people far away from this dark land, under Thy own sun, moon and stars do
      ask aid of Thee, and I, too, want Thy help. Forgive me and my people. They
      have been sinful, and vain, and thoughtless, but let them not perish in
      utter gloom. Forgive them, O thou Maker of all that exists&mdash;thou
      Creator of pain that we may love joy, Creator of evil that we may know
      good, turn not from us! We are but thoughtless children&mdash;and Thy
      children&mdash;give us time to realize the awful error of our hollow
      pretensions! Give them all now, at once, if they are to die, that spirit
      which is awakened in me by the awful majesty of Thy anger! Hear me, O
      God!&rdquo; And with a sob she sank on her knees, clasped her hands and raised
      them upward. Thorndyke tried to lift her up, but she shook her head and
      continued her prayer in silence. A marked change had come over Branasko.
      He looked at Johnston and Thorndyke in a strange, helpless way, and then,
      in a corner of the balcony the begrimed and tattered man fell on his
      knees. He knew not the meaning of prayer, but there was something in the
      reverent attitude of the princess that drew his untutored being toward his
      Maker. He covered his face with his hands and his shaggy head sank to his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnston hastened back into the Auditorium. Returning in a moment, he
      found the Englishman tenderly lifting Bernardino from her knees and
      Branasko still crouching in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the news?&rdquo; asked Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is ready for the explosion. The prince seems only waiting
      because he dreads failure. The people in there are so frightened that they
      cannot move from their seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Branasko raised a haggard face and looked appealingly at the
      princess. She caught his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, good man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the God of the Christians will not
      harm us; we are safe in His hands. I felt it here in my heart when I
      prayed to Him. Oh, why has my father and the other kings of Alpha not
      taught us that grand simple truth! But before I die I want to leave this
      dark pit of sin, and look out once into endless, world-filled space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A joyous flush came into the face of the Alphian. His fear had vanished.
      She had promised him safety. He bowed worshipfully, but he spoke not, for
      Bernardino was eagerly pointing to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried gleefully, with the merry tremolo of a happy, surprised
      child. &ldquo;The sun is not moving. Father has been successful! It is a good
      omen! God will save us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true; the sun was standing still. A deep silence was on the city.
      The crowds in the street neither moved nor spoke. Without a murmur or
      complaint they stood facing the frowning west. Suddenly the silence was
      interrupted by a low volcanic rumble. The earth heaved, and rolled, and
      far away in the suburbs of the city the spire of a public building fell
      with a loud crash. A groan swept from mouth to mouth and then died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cloud is increasing rapidly,&rdquo; said Thorndyke. &ldquo;I can really see
      little hope. I shall return in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was gone Bernardino knelt and prayed. Again overcome with fear
      Branasko crouched down in his corner. Another shudder and rumble from the
      earth, another long moan from the people. Thorndyke came back. He spoke to
      the princess:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dam built by Prince Marentel has been swept away. The ocean is
      pouring into the internal fires. There is scarcely any hope now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Branasko groaned, but Bernardino's face was aglow with celestial faith.
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not be destroyed in this way,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they have had no
      chance to know God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all depends on the explosion which may take place at any moment,&rdquo; and
      Thorndyke took her into his arms and whispered into her ear, &ldquo;I do not
      care for myself; but I cannot bear to think of your suffering pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered only by pressing his hand. The clouds were now rolling upward
      in greater volume than ever. It was growing darker. The little group on
      the balcony could now scarcely see the people below them. The fall of damp
      ashes was resumed. The air had grown hot and close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! Boom! the streets of the city rose and fell with the
      undulating motion of a swelling sea. Blacker and blacker grew the sky;
      closer and closer the atmosphere; damper and damper became the fog;
      thicker and thicker fell the wet sand and ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we would be safer in the streets,&rdquo; suggested Thorndyke, drawing
      Bernardino closer into his arms, &ldquo;the palace may fall on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the princess shook her head. &ldquo;Father would not know where to find me,
      I shall await him here.&rdquo; Branasko had edged nearer to her. His eyes were
      glued on her face and he hung on her words as if his fate were in her
      hands. He had no regard for the opinions of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explosion will soon take place now unless something has happened
      contrary to the expectations of the prince,&rdquo; said the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! kr-kr-kr-kr-boom! The noise seemed to shake the earth to its
      centre. Now the far-away pit was belching forth fire and molten lava
      rather than steam and smoke. The flames had spread out against the sloping
      roof of the cavern, and seemed to extend for a mile along the horizon.
      &ldquo;They can do nothing in that heat,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnston; &ldquo;they could not
      get near enough to the pit. Thorndyke, old fellow, I can't see a ghost of
      a chance. We might as well say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; It was the voice of the princess. &ldquo;I feel that we shall not be
      lost, I say.&rdquo; And as she spoke Branasko crept toward her and raised the
      hem of her gown to his white lips. Something dark came between them and
      the far-off glare. It was a flying-machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is father,&rdquo; cried Bernardino, and she called out to him: &ldquo;Father!
      father! Here we are, waiting for you!&rdquo; In a moment he was with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right in the east,&rdquo; he said gloomily. &ldquo;Baryonay is there. They
      deserted him, but they returned when the flames went down. This is awful,
      daughter; it means death! It means annihilation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms round his neck and drew his face close to hers. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
       she said earnestly; &ldquo;I see with a new light&mdash;a new spiritual light.
      There is mercy in the divine heart of Him that made the walls of our
      little world and constructed countless other worlds. I have prayed for
      mercy, and into my heart has come a sweet peace I never knew before. We
      shall not be lost. He will give us time to give up our sinful life here
      and seek Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man quivered as with ague; he searched her face eagerly, drew her
      spasmodically into his arms, and then sank to the floor, overcome with
      exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar in the west was increasing. Hot ashes, gravel and small stones
      were falling on the roofs and the people. Now and then a cry of pain was
      heard, but they would not seek the shelter of the buildings. If they had
      to die they wanted to fall facing the enemy. Suddenly the king rose. He
      looked to the west and groaned. Something told them that the explosion was
      coming. Expectation, horrible suspense was in the air. There was a mighty
      flare of light. The entire heavens were lighted from horizon to horizon,
      and then the light went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but the princess did not finish her
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explosion,&rdquo; said Thorndyke, &ldquo;the sound will follow in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, have mercy on us!&rdquo; cried the king. But his prayer was drowned in
      a deafening sound. Bernardino had leaned into the arms of her lover.
      &ldquo;Don't despair,&rdquo; he said tenderly, &ldquo;the prince may have been successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that he has,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But, oh, it is dreadful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowds below seemed to understand that their fate depended on the news
      that would reach them in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! kr-kr-kr-kr-boom! There seemed to be no lessening of the
      volcanic disturbance, and the earth groaned and rocked and quivered as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to tell yet,&rdquo; groaned the king. &ldquo;Oh, God, save us; give
      us a chance to escape this awful doom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston bethought himself that he might learn something in the Electric
      Auditorium and he went into it. It was empty and dark; not a soul was
      there save himself. He was turning to leave when his eye was drawn to the
      great mirror by a faint pink glow appearing upon it. He stood still, a
      superstitious fear coming over him as he thought of being alone with a
      possible messenger from the far-away scene of disaster. The light went out
      tremblingly; then it flashed up again, and the American thought he saw the
      face of Waldmeer. The light grew steadier, stronger. It was Waldmeer, but
      he was submerged in smoke. Hark! he was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marentel is successful! Entrance closed temporarily, and will be
      strengthened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnston rushed out to the balcony. &ldquo;I have been to the Auditorium,&rdquo; he
      announced. &ldquo;I have seen Waldmeer. He says the experiment was successful.
      It is closed temporarily, and can be strengthened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king grasped the hand of the American. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;if
      I can only save my people I shall desire nothing more.&rdquo; The princess moved
      toward him affectionately, but he put her aside and retired into the
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will at once communicate with the people,&rdquo; remarked Bernardino
      hopefully, and she turned her face again toward the west. The red glare
      was dying down, and the dense clouds in the sky were thinning. In an hour
      the face of the sun broke through the smoke, and the flying-machines of
      the protectors began to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the king caused the pink light of the &ldquo;Ideal Dawn&rdquo; to flood the
      eastern sky, and, as before, he appeared in a circle of dazzling light and
      addressed his subjects:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All danger to life is over; but the ultimate fate of Alpha is sealed.
      Prince Marentel has effectually closed the entrance of the ocean, but the
      internal fires are gradually burning through the rocky bed of the ocean.
      In a couple of years Alpha will be demolished. All our wealth shall be
      equally distributed among you, and my ships shall transport you to
      whatever destination you desire. Let there be no haste. Order shall be
      preserved throughout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. The king bowed and the picture faded from view. A deep
      silence was over everything. The only light came from the stars and from
      the moon. Then there was a sound like the wind passing over a vast forest
      of dry-leaved trees&mdash;the people were returning to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought they would greet the king's announcement with a
      cheer of joy,&rdquo; said Thorndyke to the princess, as they returned to the
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't know whether to weep or laugh,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They love Alpha,
      and the other world will be strange to most of them. As for myself, now
      that I am to leave, I feel a few misgivings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see that you are perfectly happy,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;You are to
      be my wife. I shall always love you and care for you; you need have no
      fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later, with joyous tears and face aglow, she assured him she
      had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END. <br /><br /><br /><br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
